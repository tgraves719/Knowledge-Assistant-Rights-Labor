Upon completion of the first (36) months of eligibility under Plan C, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll in Plan B for the next (36) months of eligibility under Plan B. Thereafter, provided the employee continues to maintain eligibility, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll and participate in Plan A.\n\nFull-time employees (excluding Courtesy Clerks) shall on the first of the month following 3 months of employment, be eligible to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan B, and after (36) months of eligibility under Plan B, shall be allowed to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan A.\n\nCourtesy Clerks hired on or after March 27, 2005 shall, beginning the later of the first of the month following thirty-six (36) months of employment or attaining the age of nineteen (19), be eligible to enroll and participate in the Health Plan on an employee only basis under the Health Plan C.
