Employees who were eligible for and were participating in Plan B on March 26, 2005, shall participate in Plan B until such employee has been covered under such Plan B for 24 months. Thereafter, such employee may advance to Plan A provided they continue to enroll and meet the eligibility requirements of the Plan. Employees hired on or before March 26, 2005, who are not eligible for coverage as of March 26, 2005 shall be required to meet initial eligibility for Plan B, and subsequent eligibility to begin participation in Plan A, as provided in the predecessor agreement which terminated in 2004.\n\nAll part-time employees (excluding Courtesy Clerks) and their eligible dependents hired on or after March 27, 2005 shall, beginning the first of the month following 12 calendar months of employment (but not before January 1, 2010 with regard to their eligible dependents), be eligible to enroll and participate in the Health Plan, under the Health Plan C. Upon completion of the first (36) months of eligibility under Plan C, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll in Plan B for the next (36) months of eligibility under Plan B. Thereafter, provided the employee continues to maintain eligibility, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll and participate in Plan A.\n\nFull-time employees (excluding Courtesy Clerks) shall on the first of the month following 3 months of employment, be eligible to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan B, and after (36) months of eligibility under Plan B, shall be allowed to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan A.\n\nCourtesy Clerks hired on or after March 27, 2005 shall, beginning the later of the first of the month following thirty-six (36) months of employment or attaining the age of nineteen (19), be eligible to enroll and participate in the Health Plan on an employee only basis under the Health Plan C.

Such Courtesy Clerks shall not be eligible to progress to Plan A.\n\nOn-going Eligibility – After satisfying initial eligibility requirement provisions and enrollment in the Health Plan, the employee must continue to meet the monthly on-going eligibility requirements as a condition of continued participation in the Health Plan. Enrolled employees who work (80) hours in a (4) week month or (100) hours in a (5) week month shall be eligible for coverage on a lag month basis. For the purpose of this Article, hours worked shall include hours paid directly by the Company for holiday, vacation, jury duty, funeral leave, and sick leave.\n\nEmployees shall continue to be eligible for benefits provided they enroll for coverage in accordance with this Article.

This rate is reflected on the attached wage charts as \"grandfathered.\"**\n\n## Basket Hours\n\n**When an employee (not at the \"thereafter\" rate) is promoted from a lower classification to a higher classification, the employee's wage shall remain the same or be advanced to the next higher wage rate if the rate does not exist in their new classification. At this point, the employee will receive credit for all hours worked with the company and those hours will determine their pay level in the new classification. The employee will then work the necessary hours in that step before receiving their next pay increase.**\n\n**When an employee (at the \"thereafter\" rate) is promoted from a lower classification to a higher classification, the employee's wage shall remain the same or be advanced to the step below the \"thereafter\" rate in their new job class, whichever is higher. At this point, the employee will receive credit for all hours worked with the company. The employee will then be required to work the last progression step of hours before moving into the \"thereafter\" rate in their new role.**\n\n**Similarly, an employee that moves from a higher classification to a lower classification, except an employee moving to meat cutter, will receive credit for all hours worked with the company and those hours will determine their pay level in the new classification (even if this results in a decrease in pay).**\n\n**Notwithstanding the above, when an associate promotes to Senior Certified Pharmacy Technician, they will start on the first step and work the hours associated with each step to advance.**\n\n**Bargaining Note: The parties intend this provision to apply in all circumstances where an employee changes job classification within the Company, including lateral transfers (for example, APC to Produce Clerk), step-downs (for example, Assistant Deli Manager to Deli Clerk), and transfers between bargaining units (for example, Coffee Clerk to Customer Service Clerk).**\n\n59PUEBLO CLERKS\n2022-2025\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nSafeway Pueblo Clerks\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n    <tr>\n        <th></th>\n        <th>Effective</th>\n
