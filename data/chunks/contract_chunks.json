    "content": "Work Schedules and Hours. Management retains the right to determine the number of hours, and start times of each shift, to be worked within each department and store. Daily scheduled shifts shall not be less than four (4) hours or more than eight (8) hours, at straight-time.\n\n**Upon mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee, a full-time employee can be allowed to work four (4) ten (10) hour days to make up the standard workweek for full-time employees. Overtime will be computed for all hours worked over forty (40). Hours worked over eight (8) in a day will not apply to full-timers working the ten (10) hour shifts provided for herein. It is also understood that all other provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, including seniority rights, will be modified as applicable toward any ten (10) hour shifts the Employer may create in the individual store. During a holiday week, employees who have normally been scheduled four (4) ten (10) hour days may be scheduled four (4) or five (5) eight (8) hour days and will receive eight (8) hours holiday pay. Employees scheduled three (3) or four (4) ten (10) hour days in a holiday week shall receive ten (10) hours holiday pay.**\n\nThe Company will use its best efforts to give employees at least two (2) hours notice if an employee is required to work beyond the end of their scheduled shift. **No employee shall be subject to discipline for failure to remain at work beyond the end of his or her scheduled shift.**\n\nNot later than ten (10) days prior to the start of any workweek, management shall post a list of shifts for each department. Non-management, employees shall be allowed to select their schedule from the posted list of shifts for which they are qualified to perform, in seniority order, within their department. Full-time employees shall select first, followed by part-time employees. No employee shall be allowed to select a schedule that will result in overtime or other penalty provision, unless expressly authorized by management. The employee's selection shall be recorded on a master work schedule. Employees shall not be permitted to select a portion of a shift. Prior to the start of the selection process, management shall identify approved vacation requests on the schedule.\n\nManagement may allow employees of one department to select shifts in another department. In this event, the employees must be qualified as defined herein, to perform the work of the other department. In addition, management reserves the right to assign, at its discretion, employees to, and designate the starting times of, any ordering shift.\n\nEmployees must immediately make their shift selections at the time directed by management. If an employee fails to promptly select, management shall select on behalf of the employee based on the employee's last written scheduling preference request. In this event, the employee waives all rights to grieve management's scheduling selection.\n\nUnless otherwise approved, or as the result of a reduction in hours, no full-time employee shall select less than forty (40) hours and no part-time employee shall select less than twenty (20) hours per week.\n\nManagement may require junior employees to select a specific number of shifts so as to facilitate the selection of all shifts from the list. In the event an employee is left with less than minimum hours, but has not been zeroed out, management may pull shifts in reverse seniority order from senior employees to get such employee to minimum hours, or management may elect to zero such employee out and assign any remaining hours in seniority order to senior employees.\n\nThe master schedule must be completed and posted by 9:00 AM on Friday prior to the start of the next workweek. Such schedule shall not be changed by management for that workweek except where such change is predicated on circumstances beyond the control of management such as sickness, injury, leaves of absence, vacations, jury duty, funeral leave, significant fluctuations in sales volume, utility failure or Acts of God. Nothing in this section should be construed as preventing management from calling in employees for extra work outside of the posted schedule, from requiring overtime work outside of the posted schedule, or from bringing in additional employees where it appears advisable in the opinion of management. If the schedule is changed pursuant to this section, and hours are reduced, then the master schedule shall be re-bid downward, from the point of the schedule change. If hours are added, such hours shall be assigned as provided in the additional hours section of this Agreement.\n\nPart-time Courtesy Clerks shall be scheduled for at least minimum hours unless otherwise agreed between the employee and management.\n\nFor purposes of this Article; non-management positions are defined as those below the level of Department Head, Assistant Department Head and Head Clerk. Time spent by employees selecting shifts shall not be considered compensable work time, but, notwithstanding, management may permit employees to select shifts on Company time. To be considered qualified, the employee must have worked in the job assignment for a minimum of six (6) months within the last two (2) years. However, employees shall be qualified for grocery/GM stocking or checking position if the employee has worked a minimum of three (3) months as a checker or stocker within the last three (3) years. Training hours, as designated by management, shall not be subject to selection by employees.",

It is understood that the employee may exercise his/her seniority to bump any time between the second and eleventh week of reduction. The employee whose schedule is claimed under this procedure shall immediately be assigned the schedule of the claiming employee, or be allowed to step-down to part-time status and displace the least senior part-time employee in their store.\n\nThe parties agree that no employee assigned as full-time on May 11, 1996, shall have his hours reduced to less than forty (40) hours as the result of this provision, unless all part-time employees in the classification have had their scheduled hours reduced to twenty-four (24) hours or less. Such full-time employee shall have his hours reduced to twenty-four (24) or less before any other full-time employee protected under this paragraph is reduced.\n\nFull-time Employees - Competitive Openings: During the first sixty (60) days following a competitive opening, management may elect, in lieu of reducing hours as provided above, to layoff full-time employees to maintain the same proportion of full-time employees to part-time employees the store averaged in the month prior to the competitive opening. In the event of a layoff, the displaced employee shall be given the following options:\n\n1) Displace the least senior full-time employee in the bargaining unit, or\n\n2) Step-down to part-time and displace the least senior part-time employee within the classification and store.\n\nEmployees displaced by the full-time reduction under this procedure shall be given their layoff options pursuant to the layoff language of this Agreement.\n\nIt is understood that the provisions of this section shall apply only to those classifications impacted by a competitive opening.",

When a reduction of the workforce is necessary, the layoff language of all Colorado collective bargaining agreements shall apply, except as modified below.**\n\n**A. Layoff will begin within the job assignment in the classification to be affected in reverse seniority order.**\n\nThe affected person shall be notified and given the following options:\n\n**1. Displace the least senior employee within the same job assignment and classification within the store.**\n\n**2. Displace the least senior employee within the same job assignment and classification within the bargaining unit.**\n\n**3.

Displace a less senior employee in a lower classification within the bargaining unit, excluding head clerk and above positions, unless qualified.**\n\n**5. Accept the layoff (recall rights as set forth in all Colorado collective bargaining agreements shall apply only to those individuals who choose the layoff and limited to job assignments previously held).**\n\n**B. For the purpose of this agreement, \"job assignments\" are defined as:**\n\n**1. Front End Supervision**\n**2. Night Crew Foreman**\n**3. Produce Head Clerk**\n**4. File Maintenance Clerk**\n**5. I.C.C. Clerks**\n**6. Variety Manager**\n**7. Grocery Manager**\n**8. Produce Manager**\n**9.

All current affected head clerks, with active grievances, shall have the options set forth above.**\n\n**III. All employees currently classified as frozen food, dairy, and GM head clerks shall be reclassified in accordance with their seniority and consistent with Article 29, Layoffs, and Article ___, Reduction of Hours, as well as the seniority provisions of the contract without recall to a head clerk position. [Note: It is understood that the reference to Article ___ is null and void as a consequence of the change negotiated between the parties with respect to former Article 34 in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.]**\n\n**IV.** The Dairy and Frozen Food full-time positions that are being vacated by persons classified as head clerks shall remain full-time positions at the time of reclassification and shall be filled by all-purpose clerks in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n**V.** It is understood and agreed that hours being vacated by head clerks or above, except GM Managers, shall become all-purpose clerk hours and will be used to create as many full-time positions as is possible. It is understood and agreed that the Company retains the right to employ part-time head clerks.\n\n**VI.** This settlement agreement shall apply to all collective bargaining agreements between Safeway Stores, Inc. and Local No. 7 in Colorado and shall have a term co-existent with the current collective bargaining agreements.\n\n**Section 80. Layoff Procedures, applicable only to Colorado Springs retail clerks and meat bargaining units.** Clarifies layoff procedures on Section 77 of the retail clerks contract and Section 97 of the retail meat contract for Colorado Springs.\n\n**1.** This agreement pertains to the implementation of layoff procedures in Section 97 of the retail meat contract and Section 77 of the retail clerks contract for the Colorado Springs bargaining units.\n\n**2.** The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that to the greatest extent possible in circumstances when multiple layoffs are necessary, the Company will operate the layoff procedures in Section 97 (retail meat) and Section 77 (retail clerks) so that the least senior employees in the bargaining unit will be the employees who are laid off. Therefore, the Company will discontinue its current practice. Instead, the Company will complete the process of offering and having the employee choose the layoff options with the first affected employee before going to the second affected employee, then will complete the layoff options with the second affected employee before going to the next employee, and so forth.\n\n**3. Time limit for exercising options.** When a reduction in the work force is necessary, the Company will notify the affected employee of his/her options in accordance with Section 97 of the retail meat contract of Section 77 of the retail clerks contract. If the affected person is notified of his/her layoff options before 11:00 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company's designated representative (the district secretary, store manager, or other person handling the matter for the Company) of his/her chosen option by no later than 4:00 p.m. on the same day. If the affected person is notified of his/her options after 11:00 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company's representative of the chosen option by 8:30 a.m. on the next day. These are outside time limits, and the affected person is free to inform the Company of which option he/she chooses sooner than these time limits.\n\n**4. Effect of not exercising option within time limits.** If the affected person does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits set forth above, the affected person will be deemed to have exercised the first option specified in Section 97 (retail meat) or Section 77 (retail clerks) that is available, assuming that the affected person qualifies for such option when the contract requires qualifications. For example, if a retail clerk employee does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits, he/she will be deemed to have chosen the option in Section 77 of displacing a less senior employee within the same classification in the store\n\n**or, if such option is unavailable, of displacing the least senior employee within the same classification in the bargaining unit.**",

If any change in working**\n\nconditions is contrary to any express provisions of the labor agreement, the Company will not make such change without mutual agreement with the union.\n\n**Employee Leave.** If any employee is unable to perform work due to the nature of the emergency, the Company and the Union will meet and discuss in good faith the proper application of the leave of absence provisions provided by Article 32 of this Agreement and/or any additional leave that the parties may mutually agree to provide.\n\n**Layoffs.** Any layoffs (or recall of employees) as a direct result of the emergency shall be in accordance with the seniority provisions of Articles 27 and 29 of the Agreement. The Company and the Union may mutually agree to modify or extend various terms (e.g., the parties may agree to extend the period of time an employee may be on layoff without losing seniority).\n\n**Dangerous Emergencies.** The Employer will develop procedures that workers should follow to protect themselves and co-workers during dangerous emergencies. These procedures may include: (i) where workers should go to protect themselves, (ii) evacuation plans, (iii) what workers should do, and (iv) how prompt first aid and emergency medical treatment will be administered to injured workers. The procedures will also discuss signs that may indicate that a dangerous emergency may occur (such as threats, social media posts or assaults), and encourage workers, customers and others to report these matters to a manager or security guard, if applicable. The Employer will update the training as new procedures to protect workers against dangerous emergencies develop.\n\nThe Company may consider training all workers on the dangerous emergency procedures, including how to recognize a potentially dangerous emergency and, where appropriate, how to de-escalate dangerous emergencies that are reasonably capable of de-escalation. Expert professional trainers will conduct or facilitate all trainings. New hires will undergo this training within the first thirty (30) days of employment.\n\nDuring a dangerous emergency the Employer agrees that employees do not bear any responsibility to protect any merchandise. Employees should protect themselves and, to the extent safely and reasonably possible, co-workers/customers. The Employer acknowledges that employees have a right to defend themselves if there are no other options to avoid the dangerous situation. The Employer agrees to notify the President of the Union, or his or her designee, immediately upon learning of a dangerous emergency.\n\n**Section 110. Pandemic Safety Measures.** In the event of a novel pandemic or epidemic affecting one or more of the stores, the Employer agrees to meet and bargain with the Union concerning the effects thereof within fourteen (14) days following a written request by the Union. The Employer further agrees to follow applicable CDC, NIOSH, or OSHA guidelines and any state and federal mandates concerning the pandemic or epidemic. The Employer agrees that employees shall have access to hand sanitizer and other appropriate sanitation products.\n\nThe Employer agrees that it shall train managers, supervisors, and employees on applicable safety measures.\n\n**Section 111. Vaccine Mandate.** In the event the Employer determines it intends to implement a vaccine mandate, the Employer agrees to meet with the Union and bargain effects of the mandate as far in advance of the mandate's effective date as possible, but not less than two (2) weeks in advance of the mandate's effective date.",

    "content": "Trust Fund. The Rocky Mountain UFCW Unions and Employers Health Benefit Trust (\"Health Benefit Trust\") is a trust fund jointly administered by an equal number of Trustees representing the Employer and the Union. All contributions provided for in this Article will be paid into the Health Benefit Trust. The Trust Fund is to be jointly administered by an equal number of Trustees representing the Employer and the Union. There shall be three (3) Plans of benefits, Plan A, Plan B and Plan C with contributions as provided herein. As a condition of receiving the contributions provided above, the Trustees of the Plan will:\n\n1. Establish Plan(s) of benefits, which can be supported by the contributions provided in this Agreement, and\n\n2. Maintain the Trust in a fully funded status as provided herein and in the Trust Agreement.\n\nThe Trustees shall establish a separate accounting of income and expenses for participants of the Fund who agree in their collective bargaining Agreements to a fixed contribution rate. The Trustees are expressly prohibited from using the contributions of the Employer's contributing on fixed contribution rate basis to pay benefits for participants of other employers who have not adopted these fixed contributions.\n\nEmployer Contributions and Benefit Levels - The Employer agrees to contribute the following amounts per month for each eligible employee.\n\n \n \n\n | Current | \n | January 2022 hours payable | \n | January 2023 hours payable | \n | January 2024 hours payable | \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n | | \n | | \n | | \n | in February \n2022 | \n | in February \n\n“Up to” | \n | in February \n\n“Up to” | \n \n\n \n \n\n | | \n | Plan A Hired Before \n3/5/2005 | \n | $988.78 | \n | $ 1,030.31 | \n | $ 1,081.82 | \n | $ 1,135.92 | \n \n\n | | \n | Plan A Hired After 3/5/2005 | \n | $ 850.59 | \n | $ 886.31 | \n | $930.63 | \n | $977.16 | \n \n\n | | \n | Plan B Hired Before \n3/5/2005 | \n | $791.01 | \n | $ 824.23 | \n | $ 865.44 | \n | $ 908.72 | \n \n\n | | \n | Plan B Hired After 3/5/2005 | \n | $ 680.47 | \n | $ 709.05 | \n | $ 744.50 | \n | $ 781.73 | \n \n\n | | \n | Plan C Hired After 3/5/2005 | \n | $ 428.68 | \n | $ 446.68 | \n | $ 469.02 | \n | $ 492.47 | \n \n\nThe \"up to\" rates for **2023 and 2024** will be determined as following:\n\n1. Using the latest financial data available as of **each September (or most recently available data in preparation for the December fund meeting)**, co-consultants will develop a forecast through 12/31/2024.\n\n2. In preparing the forecast, the below trend rates will be used.\n\n3. If the forecast projects an ending balance at 12/31/**2024** that is below the target reserve level (average of 1.4 months of expense for the 12 months ending 12/31/**2024**, plus IBNR at 12/31/**2024**), then the employer contributions will be increased effective January **2023** and **2024** so that the ending reserve will be equal to the target reserve. **Any projected deficit in the ending balance shall first be corrected by increasing the 2023 employer contribution rates until such rates reach the \"up to\" levels for 2023.** In no event will the increase in the employer contributions rates exceed **5.0% in 2023 or 2024.** In no event will the **\"up to\"** employer contribution rates be less than the **prior year's** employer contribution rate.\n\n4. Co-consultants will work together to develop increases that are as close as possible. In the event co-consultants develop materially different estimates, the lowest increase will be implemented while Trustees resolve the differences between the two estimates of the co-consultants. Any arbitration concerning the differences between the two estimates shall be held not more than sixty (60) days following deadlock.\n\nAgreed upon trend:\n\n \n\n | Year | \n | 2022 | \n | 2023 | \n | 2024 | \n \n\n | PPO Medical | \n | 6.5% | \n | 6.5% | \n | 6.5% | \n \n\n | Prescription Drug | \n | 8.0% | \n | 8.0% | \n | 8.0% | \n \n\n | Dental | \n | 4.0% | \n | 4.0% | \n | 4.0% | \n \n\n | Vision | \n | 3.0% | \n | 3.0% | \n | 3.0% | \n \n\n | Time Loss | \n | 0.0% | \n | 0.0% | \n | 0.0% | \n \n\n | Kaiser Premium | \n | 6.5% | \n | 6.5% | \n | 6.5% | \n \n\n | Medicare \nAdvantage | \n | Actual | \n | Actual | \n | Actual | \n \n\n | Life Premium | \n | 0.0% | \n | 0.0% | \n | 0.0% | \n \n\n | Provider Access \nFees | \n | Actual | \n | Actual | \n | Actual | \n \n\n | Stop Loss \nPremiums | \n | Actual | \n | Actual | \n | Actual | \n \n\n \n \n\n | Administration | \n | 3.0% | \n | 3.0% | \n | 3.0% | \n \n\n | Investment Income | \n | 1.25% | \n | 1.25% | \n | 1.25% | \n \n\n \n\nEmployee Co-Premiums: Effective January 1, 2013, the required weekly co-premium amounts for all active employees enrolled in the Plan shall become: $7.50/week for employee only, $15/week for employee and children or employee and spouse and $23/week for employee, spouse and children/family. **Effective January 1, 2023, the required weekly co-premium amounts for all active employees enrolled in the Plan shall become: $8.50/week for employee only, $17/week for employee and children or employee and spouse and $26/week for employee, spouse and children/family.** Such co-premiums shall be made by payroll deduction and forwarded to the Trust Fund on a monthly basis by the Employer.\n\nEnrollment and Eligibility: Effective calendar year enrollment period beginning January 1, 2010, the Plan shall conduct an annual enrollment in accordance with the following procedure.\n\nGeneral Rule\n\n* Currently Enrolled\n\n * If enrolled for 2009 and no changes desired - need not do anything – terms of enrollment for 2009 remain in effect until coverage under the Plan terminates or until changes desired.\n\n * If enrolled and changes desired - need to timely complete new enrollment form on same basis as in prior years.\n\n * If not enrolled for 2009, but want to enroll for 2010 or for a subsequent year, need to timely complete enrollment form on same basis as in prior years.\n\n* Newly eligible employee must initially make a positive election to enroll in the Plan. Terms of initial enrollment will remain in effect until coverage under the Plan terminates or until changes desired.\n\nSpecial Rules\n\n* Newly eligible employees – must enroll within 90 days.\n\n* Current special enrollment event rules that remain in effect\n\n* Newly acquired dependent – must enroll within 30 days. The effective date of coverage will be:\n\n* Marriage – the date of marriage.\n\n* Birth of a dependent – the date of birth.\n\n* Adoption or Placement for Adoption of Dependent – date of adoption or placement for adoption.\n\n• Employee or dependent lose coverage under another plan – must enroll within 30 days (Exception: If loss of coverage is under this Plan, individual has 60 days to enroll under Plan). The effective date of coverage will be the first day of the month following the termination of coverage.\n\n• Special disenrollment rules that remain in effect:\n\n ▫ Dependent spouse becomes covered under spouse's employer's plan or employment status so that the spouse is no longer eligible to participate in a health plan sponsored or maintained by his/her employer - Plan must be notified within 60 days of spouse's coverage to discontinue payment of working spouse fee. The cessation of the working spouse fee is prospective only.\n\n ▫ Disenrollment – if dependent loses status as eligible dependent or an employee or dependent becomes covered under another plan – must disenroll within 60 days of event causing loss of coverage or effective date of coverage under another plan. The reduction in the weekly payroll deduction is prospective only.\n\n• New procedures/rules.\n\n ▫ Administration office will need to do semi-annual verification of continuation of student status of known students plus any child who attains age 19 in the spring and fall of each calendar year.\n\n ▫ For first claim filed by spouse each calendar year, administration office will need to verify working status of spouse and if working, determine if covered by employer's plan.\n\n• Continuation of Rule Regarding Special Enrollment Events\n\n • Employees currently enrolled in the Plan shall continue to be enrolled in the Plan unless they made a positive election to discontinue their enrollment or change their coverage. A discontinuation in coverage may be made within sixty (60) days of a special enrollment event as defined by the Plan. Administrative office will need to do semi-annual verification.\n\nEmployees must initially make a positive election to enroll in the Plan. Enrollment is for the entire plan of benefits for the Plan and an employee's failure to make an initial positive enrollment into the Plan shall result in such employee being ineligible for all benefits of the Plan for the remainder of the calendar year or until there has been a special enrollment event as provided in the Plan's Rules and Regulations, whichever occurs first.\n\nThe administrator of the fund will use the enrollment data in order to establish the eligibility of employees and their dependents for participation in plan coverage. None other than those employees contained on the enrollment report shall receive benefits from the Trust without the express authorization of the Trustees. The administrator will promptly notify the Trustees in writing of any instances where coverage has been provided to\n\npersons who are not included in the enrollment data, or where a claim for payment has been submitted by or on behalf of such person.\n\nThe Fund will audit its enrollment and claims records at least once within each 24 month period to ensure that no employees of the Employer, or the dependents of such employees, are participating in plan coverage for which they are not eligible and to ascertain that claims and other plan expenses are being paid in accordance with the Plan's provisions.\n\nInitial Eligibility – Part-time employees hired before March 27, 2005 who on March 26, 2005, have met the initial eligibility requirement for benefits under the Trust will continue to be eligible for coverage provided the employee enrolls in the Plan beginning in 2005, and further provided the employee has made the required employee co-premium payment. Such employees shall continue to be eligible for Plan A if such employee was eligible for Plan A on March 26, 2005. Employees who were eligible for and were participating in Plan B on March 26, 2005, shall participate in Plan B until such employee has been covered under such Plan B for 24 months. Thereafter, such employee may advance to Plan A provided they continue to enroll and meet the eligibility requirements of the Plan. Employees hired on or before March 26, 2005, who are not eligible for coverage as of March 26, 2005 shall be required to meet initial eligibility for Plan B, and subsequent eligibility to begin participation in Plan A, as provided in the predecessor agreement which terminated in 2004.\n\nAll part-time employees (excluding Courtesy Clerks) and their eligible dependents hired on or after March 27, 2005 shall, beginning the first of the month following 12 calendar months of employment (but not before January 1, 2010 with regard to their eligible dependents), be eligible to enroll and participate in the Health Plan, under the Health Plan C. Upon completion of the first (36) months of eligibility under Plan C, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll in Plan B for the next (36) months of eligibility under Plan B. Thereafter, provided the employee continues to maintain eligibility, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll and participate in Plan A.\n\nFull-time employees (excluding Courtesy Clerks) shall on the first of the month following 3 months of employment, be eligible to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan B, and after (36) months of eligibility under Plan B, shall be allowed to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan A.\n\nCourtesy Clerks hired on or after March 27, 2005 shall, beginning the later of the first of the month following thirty-six (36) months of employment or attaining the age of nineteen (19), be eligible to enroll and participate in the Health Plan on an employee only basis under the Health Plan C. Upon completion of the first thirty-six (36) months of employee only eligibility under Plan C, such Courtesy Clerks and their eligible dependents may enroll in Plan B. Such Courtesy Clerks shall not be eligible to progress to Plan A.\n\nOn-going Eligibility – After satisfying initial eligibility requirement provisions and enrollment in the Health Plan, the employee must continue to meet the monthly on-going eligibility requirements as a condition of continued participation in the Health Plan. Enrolled employees who work (80) hours in a (4) week month or (100) hours in a (5) week month shall be eligible for coverage on a lag month basis. For the purpose of this Article, hours worked shall include hours paid directly by the Company for holiday, vacation, jury duty, funeral leave, and sick leave.\n\nEmployees shall continue to be eligible for benefits provided they enroll for coverage in accordance with this Article. In any event, all employees must continue to meet all eligibility requirements of the Plan as a condition of continued eligibility.\n\nTrust Plan Changes. The Trustees at the earliest possible date but not later than June 1, 2005, shall revise the plan of benefits to include:\n\n1. The Plan's current coordination of benefit provision and credit balance system shall be replaced with a coordination of benefit provision that limits payment to the maximum payable under the Plan.\n\n2. The Plan shall adopt a fee of one hundred dollars ($100) per month for a spouse of a covered employee who is eligible to enroll in health coverage at their employer, but fails to do so, as a condition of enrollment in this Plan.\n\n3. Adopt the long term funding policy contained herein.\n\n4. The Parties agree to adopt true managed care approaches to providing mental/nervous and physical benefits under the Plan. The Plan Administrator should not perform such managed care.\n\n5. The Parties will adopt cost control measures that will aid the Fund in managing costs within the contributions provided by the Employers and Participants to this Plan.\n\nEffective January 1, 2010, the Trustees of the Plan shall be directed to adopt the following modifications to the active plan(s) of benefits:\n\n## Health and Care Management\n\nDirect Trustees to Implement Integrated Health and Care Management Programs. The programs shall be designed to progress over the term of the Agreement to \"best-in-class\" levels with respect to the key characteristics listed below:\n\n* Quality education campaign for all participants\n* Superior participant communications, including robust web tools\n* Superior participant information tools\n* Analytics measuring participation, compliance, and results\n* Very strong comprehensiveness of programs\n* High levels of integration\n* Strong physician behavior change mechanisms\n* Significant levels of medical and drug trend reduction\n\n1. Establish a health risk assessment questionnaire to be completed annually. If employee and spouse complete annually, such employee's co-premium to the Plan shall be reduced $5 per month for each employee and spouse (max $10) for that enrollment's calendar year. An HRQ must be completed each year during enrollment to be eligible to receive the HRQ incentive for each year. During the term of this Agreement, the Trustees may, by mutual agreement, reallocate the HRQ incentive amounts provided above.\n\n2. Establish 24-hour nurse call-in line and/or medical decision support.\n\n3. Develop a medical management program that targets high-risk participants with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, asthma and cardiovascular disease. In order to encourage participant engagement in such programs and\n\nto enhance the goal of improving health status a series of incentives must be developed.\n\nThere is recognition that incentives may take various forms and will likely evolve and change over time based on program experience with a goal of maximizing program effectiveness and reducing health costs and medical trend. The initial focus will be a thorough educational campaign in connection with program roll out.\n\n4. Establish free and/or reduced cost educational programs such as:\n\n a. Weight management\n b. Smoking cessation\n c. High Cholesterol\n\n5. Reduce prescription drug co-pays as shown below for participants taking maintenance drugs (and related supplies which require a prescription) for certain disease states which would include categories of drugs such as:\n\n a. Hypertension\n b. High cholesterol\n c. Diabetes control drugs\n d. Asthma\n e. Glaucoma\n f. Osteoporosis\n\n \n \n\n | Drug Class | \n | Co‑Pay | \n \n\n \n \n\n | Generic | \n | $2.50 | \n \n\n | Formulary Brand | \n | $10 | \n \n\n | Nonformulary Brand | \n | $20 | \n \n\nIt is understood that the Plan's consultants will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of including these scheduled drug categories on Plan costs and based on their recommendations the Trustees may remove drugs from this list and/or add other categories of drugs consistent with the objective of increasing compliance with prescribed drug therapies which will lower plan costs and trend.\n\n6. Complex/Catastrophic Care Management to provide case management of the entire health care and treatment for participants with high-risk health conditions.\n\n7. Preventive health care at medically appropriate times (see below)\n\n \n \n\n | Service | \n | PPO coverage (In-network) | \n \n\n | Mammography | \n | Plan pays 100% | \n \n\n | Routine Annual Physical Exam | \n | Plan pays 100% | \n \n\n | Well-baby care | \n | Plan pays 100% | \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n | Childhood Immunizations | \n | Plan pays 100% | \n \n\n | Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and pelvic examination | \n | Plan pays 100% | \n \n\n | Prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing | \n | Plan pays 100% | \n \n\n | Colonoscopy | \n | Plan pays 100% | \n \n\n \n\nUtilize nationally recognized guidelines as a basis for coverage.\n\nTrust Plan Changes: The Trustees of the Plan shall be directed to make the following adjustments to the benefits of the Plan:\n\nEffective January 1, 2016, increase the disability benefit cap to three hundred dollars ($300.00).\n\n**Effective January 1, 2022 the weekly disability benefit cap shall increase to four hundred ($400.00) dollars. In addition, as soon as practicable, the Trustees are directed to explore options for more affordable stop loss coverage, and, if unavailable, discontinue the purchase of stop loss coverage.**\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, Plan B's dental benefit shall become identical to the dental benefit for Plan A. Effective January 1, 2020, any employee and their dependents who are enrolled in Plan B shall receive the improved dental benefit.\n\n## Long Term Funding Policy\n\n1. The parties recommend to the trustees that a Minimum Reserve Requirement be established equal to IBNR reserves plus a lag month reserve. The Fund consultants shall calculate the IBNR and lag month reserve requirement at least once every twelve months beginning on (date) and report these amounts to the Trustees at their next regularly scheduled meeting. Any withdrawing employer shall reimburse the Fund for their participants claims run off.\n\n2. If the market value of the assets at any twelve-month review point is ever below the calculated IBNR level as calculated by the Fund consultants, then the Fund consultants shall prepare recommendations for benefit plan redesign and/or employee co-premium contributions such that the dollar amount of any such deficiency will be fully recovered by the end of the 12-month period beginning after the trustee meeting in which the deficiency is first projected.\n\n3. No changes are permitted that would violate any contractual agreement between the Fund and any third party vendor.\n\n4. If the Fund consultants cannot agree on a recommended plan of benefit redesign and/or employee co-premium contributions, and the Trustees cannot agree to a corrective action plan, by virtue of deadlock motions, then the trustees must act to adopt the recommended corrective action plan that has the least adverse impact on plan participants, however, one set of Trustees may exercise the Fund's dispute resolution procedure on an expedited basis to determine if other corrective actions must be taken.\n\n5. The minimum reserve target defined above is solely meant to be a \"floor\". It is not also a \"ceiling\". That is, no Trustee action is required or expected in the event that reserve levels are above the minimum reserve target.\n\n6. The Long-Term Funding Policy provisions of this Article are suspended for the period of May 13, 2012 through and including September 12, 2015.\n\nExtended Benefits. An employee who has been eligible for benefits for six (6) months or more immediately prior to becoming physically disabled and thereby unable to work, shall continue to be eligible for benefits during his continuing period of disability, up to a maximum of six (6) months.\n\nCourtesy Clerk Coverage. Courtesy Clerks who are qualified for coverage under any other Plan as a dependent are not entitled to benefits under the Health Benefit Trust; except that under the coordination of benefits provision as established by the Trustees, where a Courtesy Clerk is covered as a dependent under any other \"Plan,\" shall be considered the primary carrier and this Health Benefit Trust shall be considered as secondary carrier.\n\nRetiree's Benefits. The Employer will contribute eighteen dollars and thirty-four cents ($18.34) per month per eligible active bargaining unit employee, covered under this Agreement, in the Health Plan to subsidize the self-pay costs of providing Health and Welfare benefits to eligible retirees under the Rocky Mountain UFCW Unions and Employers Health Benefit Plan (the \"Retiree's Health Plan\").\n\nEffective for employees who retire on or after October 1, 1996, the eligibility requirements for participation in Retiree's Health Plan shall be:\n\nEmployees retiring on or after October 1, 1996, must have a combined total of 15 years of service and have attained age 50, or be totally disabled, at the time of his termination of employment.",

Once a grievance has been requested for arbitration, the parties may agree to submit the grievance to a mediator. The parties shall use a mutually agreed upon mediator.\n\na) The parties will contact the mediator and schedule a date for the mediation conference to be held on a monthly basis effective immediately.\n\nb) The grievant and location manager shall be present for the conference. Each party shall be permitted to have not more than two additional observers. Observers shall not be permitted to offer testimony or make oral statements.\n\nc) The proceedings shall be informal and the formal rules of evidence shall not apply. Each party will make a brief presentation of the facts of their case not to exceed 15 minutes. The Grievant and Location Manager may also make an oral explanation of their case not to exceed five minutes. The parties may also submit other written evidence, statements, etc., to the mediator, witnesses and oral testimony, provided that such testimony does not exceed the 20-minute total set forth above.\n\nd) The mediator will have the authority to meet with each party separately and to recommend a reasonable settlement to the grievance. The mediator shall have the authority to compel the resolution of the grievance. Grievances ruled upon or settled shall be considered final and binding and may not be further processed to arbitration.\n\ne) All settlements or rulings shall be on a non-precedent setting basis and without prejudice to either party, except settlements may specifically provide otherwise.\n\nf) The parties agree to attempt to schedule multiple grievances per mediation conference. Further, the parties agree to share expenses of the mediator.\n\nThis agreement shall be effective on the date of execution of this agreement and may be cancelled by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.",

    "content": "EXPEDITED ARBITRATION PROCEDURES\n\nEffective upon ratification of this agreement, the parties signatory below agree to adopt an expedited arbitration procedure as outlined below. Notwithstanding the provisions of such agreement, the parties recognize that arbitrations already scheduled prior to the effective date of this agreement shall be arbitrated as in the past and not subject to the provisions of this agreement unless the parties mutually agree to do so.\n\nA mutually agreed upon arbitrator shall be selected to hear cases arising under this procedure. The parties will direct the arbitrator to set aside one day per month to hear arbitrations under his procedure. As near as practical, such dates will be during the second or fourth week of each month. If necessary, and the parties mutually agree, the arbitrators will be asked to set aside more days per month.\n\nThe parties shall attempt to meet biweekly to review cases pending arbitration and to schedule cases for arbitration under this procedure. Should a case scheduled for arbitration be settled prior to the scheduled date, the parties will make an earnest effort to substitute another case for the scheduled date.\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in this agreement, all discipline cases, including discharges, shall be subject to the provisions of this procedure. Contract interpretation cases, upon mutual agreement by both parties, shall also be subject to this procedure. For discipline cases, other than discharges, both parties agree, where practical, to schedule at least two such cases to be heard on one day, with the understanding that the presentation of such cases shall not exceed four hours, with both sides being allocated two hours for the presentation of their case and cross-examination of witnesses of the opposing side.\n\nFor all discipline cases, including discharges, both parties will make closing oral arguments unless mutually agreed otherwise, and the arbitrator will issue a brief written award. Where practical, the parties will direct the arbitrator to issue a written bench decision and summarize his decision in a one-page letter following the arbitration. The arbitrator, at his discretion, may request no more than seven days to deliberate on the issues of a particular case. In this regard, an arbitrator will issue his award within fourteen days following the close of the hearing.\n\nBoth parties will direct the arbitrator to issue an abbreviated, which details only the arbitrator's award and a brief explanation as to the reasons for this award. In the case of contract interpretive matters, both parties recognize the need to file briefs and have the arbitrator write a detailed decision. In this regard, both parties agree to file briefs within two weeks following the close of the hearing and will direct the arbitrator to issue an abbreviated decision which details only the arbitrator's award within two weeks following the receipt of briefs. The arbitrator will then issue a detailed decision within thirty days following receipt of the briefs by the parties.\n\nEither party may, by notification to the other prior to a case being scheduled, exclude a particular case from the provisions of this agreement. In this case, the arbitration shall be scheduled and handled under the normal procedure.\n\nProvisions of this agreement are hereby entered into by both parties signatory below and in full force and effect, unless either party, through written notification to the other party, gives thirty (30) days written notice of their intent to cancel this agreement. In this regard, the parties agree that cases scheduled for arbitration under this procedure shall proceed to arbitration as provided above.\n\n## Section \n**1. The parties recognize that the information requests that routinely accompany grievances filed by Local 7 can be burdensome and time consuming for the Company to respond to, which in turn impacts the effective and efficient administration of the grievance procedure. Accordingly, Local 7 has committed to reviewing the information requests it has accompanying pending grievances as well as information requests it may file with future grievances to determine whether the information requests can appropriately be withdrawn or tailored more narrowly in scope.**\n\n**2. The parties also agree to schedule monthly settlement meetings at which the parties will discuss the possible settlement or withdrawal of grievances pending arbitration.**\n\n**3. The parties will work from an agenda containing cases pending arbitration ranked in order of date filed with the exception that cases involving termination, demotion, or potential continuing liability shall be moved to the top of the agenda in date order and shall be discussed before any other case. The**\n\nagenda will be prepared one week from the date of the meeting and may then only be modified by agreement of the parties.\n\n4. The parties will endeavor to discuss as many cases as can reasonably be considered at each monthly settlement meeting.\n\na. Cases that are settled or dropped/withdrawn by the Union shall be removed from the agenda and shall be deemed closed.\n\nb. Cases that are continued at the monthly settlement meeting pending further review or investigation shall remain on the agenda for discussion at future monthly settlement meetings.\n\nc. Cases that have been discussed but not resolved may, at the option of the grieving party, be scheduled for arbitration as provided below.\n\n5. Grievances referred to arbitration shall be placed in the scheduling queue and scheduled for hearing as follows:\n\na. Cases shall be scheduled from the scheduling queue in order of their respective grievance filing date with the understanding termination or demotion cases shall move to the front of the scheduling queue in date order.\n\nb. The party requesting arbitration shall promptly request a panel of arbitrators from FMCS for each case placed in the scheduling queue.\n\nc. Within sixty (60) days after a final settlement meeting decision, the parties will select an arbitrator.\n\nd. The parties will use best efforts to schedule the hearing in the matter for which an arbitrator has been appointed within six (6) months following a final settlement meeting decision with the understanding that the parties may schedule a hearing a date later than six (6) months upon mutual agreement or as the result of 6(e) below.\n\ne. Notwithstanding the provisions of 6(d) above, neither party shall be required or obligated to schedule more than three (3) cases per calendar month except by mutual agreement.\n\nf. In all disciplinary cases referred to arbitration, as a condition to accepting appointment, the arbitrator must agree to render a decision and award no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the parties' post hearing statements. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, such statements must be filed no later than fourteen (14) days following the close of the hearing (or receipt of transcript where applicable) and must be limited to no more than ten (10) single space letter size pages. It is specifically agreed and understood that any such case resolved under this procedure shall be deemed \"nonprecedential\" and will not be cited by either party in any future proceeding. The provisions of this subsection (e) may be modified on a case by case basis by mutual agreement of the parties.\n\nThe Company's Director of Labor Relations and the Union President will retain jurisdiction over this letter of understanding and may, by mutual agreement, modify this letter of understanding as they deem necessary and appropriate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agreements' grievance and arbitration process. Any such modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties.",

Contact the Plan Administrator at 303-430-9334 or 1-800-527-1647 with any questions you may have.\n\nAppendix \"A\"\n\nThe minimum hourly rates of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.\n\n**Bargaining Note: Although the parties have agreed to move certain classifications to the same rate, it is expressly understood and agreed that selection of shifts will be done separately in each department, and that additional hours will be offered to other employees in a given department prior to being offered to other employees in the bargaining unit. The Union and Employer agree that notwithstanding any inclusion of a dollars-per-hour metric in the 5-star cake decorator matrix, this does not constitute a production standard.**\n\n**The Employer agrees that for those positions identified with a grandfathered rate on the attached wage tables, any individual who held a classification and rate so identified as of January 11, 2022, shall be grandfathered during the term of this Agreement at fifty cents ($0.50) over the otherwise applicable wage rate, and shall receive the benefit of future increases. This rate is reflected on the attached wage charts as \"grandfathered.\"**\n\n## Basket Hours\n\n**When an employee (not at the \"thereafter\" rate) is promoted from a lower classification to a higher classification, the employee's wage shall remain the same or be advanced to the next higher wage rate if the rate does not exist in their new classification. At this point, the employee will receive credit for all hours worked with the company and those hours will determine their pay level in the new classification. The employee will then work the necessary hours in that step before receiving their next pay increase.**\n\n**When an employee (at the \"thereafter\" rate) is promoted from a lower classification to a higher classification, the employee's wage shall remain the same or be advanced to the step below the \"thereafter\" rate in their new job class, whichever is higher. At this point, the employee will receive credit for all hours worked with the company. The employee will then be required to work the last progression step of hours before moving into the \"thereafter\" rate in their new role.**\n\n**Similarly, an employee that moves from a higher classification to a lower classification, except an employee moving to meat cutter, will receive credit for all hours worked with the company and those hours will determine their pay level in the new classification (even if this results in a decrease in pay).**\n\n**Notwithstanding the above, when an associate promotes to Senior Certified Pharmacy Technician, they will start on the first step and work the hours associated with each step to advance.**\n\n**Bargaining Note: The parties intend this provision to apply in all circumstances where an employee changes job classification within the Company, including lateral transfers (for example, APC to Produce Clerk), step-downs (for example, Assistant Deli Manager to Deli Clerk), and transfers between bargaining units (for example, Coffee Clerk to Customer Service Clerk).**\n\nSafeway Pueblo Clerks\n\n \n \n\n | | \n | Effective | \n | Effective | \n | Effective | \n \n\n \n \n\n | CLASSIFICATION | \n | 1/23/2022 | \n | 1/22/2023 | \n

    "content": "## PROCEDURE FOR SCHEDULING EMPLOYEES WITH CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO WORKING ON THEIR DAY OF SABBATH\n\nWe have had a number of requests for the procedure in the handling of employees scheduled on a day which is their day of Sabbath. Safeway has entered into an agreement with UFCW which provides certain procedures for accommodating individuals who have such conscientious objections.\n\nProblems can result in a grievance under the contract as well as a possible violation of the laws against discrimination on the basis of religion, so please follow these procedures carefully and call Safeway Inc. Human Resources if necessary.\n\nThis procedure, of course, applies only to any employee who advised you:\n\n1. that they have conscientious objections to working a particular day of the week.\n\n2. the nature of their conscientious objections, and\n\n3. the particular day of the week which they are unable to work.\n\nIf you have any questions concerning whether the employee actually has bona fide conscientious objections, be certain to contact Employee Relations and review the matter. You also should complete the form attached to these instructions, ask the employee to sign it, and route it to Safeway Inc. Human Resources Department for future reference.\n\nThe procedure for scheduling is as follows:\n\n1. Until noon on Saturday for the following week's schedule an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with any employee junior to him in the same job classification in the store which will result in the employee obtaining their Sabbath as a day off. You may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail, and the junior employee cannot refuse to make the trade.\n\n2. As an option, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with a senior employee who is willing to make such an exchange.",

Either party may choose to terminate this letter of understanding when such agreements expire.\n\n## 4. Estes Park Store SW 920 (Retail Clerks Contract). Transfers of Employees from Outside the Unit. Clarifies seniority rights for Head Clerks and other management employees who transfer into this store. Signed by Bruce Trull for Safeway on 12-19-94 and Michael Belo for UFCW Local 7 on 1-3-95.\n\n1. This agreement pertains to the interpretation of Article 27, Section 63, which provides as follows, in relevant part: \"Seniority for employees who transfer into the store from another bargaining unit will begin on the first (1st) day they work in the Estes Park store, except the Company shall have the right to transfer a maximum of one (1) employee per bargaining unit per year into the store who shall retain their original seniority date with the Employer after they have worked for six (6) consecutive months in the Estes Park store.\"\n\n2. A dispute has arisen between the Union and the Employer about whether the above provision applies to transfers of head clerks or to transfers of other management employees who are included in the bargaining unit or, even if not included in the unit when transferred, are demoted or step down into the bargaining unit after their transfer. The parties agree to resolve the dispute as set forth below.\n\n3. In the event that the Employer transfers head clerks or other management employees into the Estes Park store, such employees will have seniority from the date they begin working in the Estes Park store until two years have passed. After two years of working continuously in the store, such employees will regain their company seniority, i.e., length of continu",
