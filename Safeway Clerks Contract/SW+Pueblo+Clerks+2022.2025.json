If a member of the bargaining unit classified as a Head Clerks or above is demoted, voluntarily or involuntarily, and has been employed in the bargaining unit for a minimum of one continuous year prior to the demotion, the employee may be returned to the classification and status, full-time or part-time, when first promoted to the bargaining unit position of Head Clerk or above.

If a member of the bargaining unit classified as Head Clerk of above is demoted voluntarily or involuntarily, and has not been employed in the bargaining unit for one continuous year prior to the demotion, the employee shall be placed in the position of a Courtesy Clerk.\n\n4. If a management employee who is not a member of the bargaining unit is demoted, voluntarily or involuntarily, into a non-management bargaining unit position, the employee may exercise full Company seniority from the date of such demotion, notwithstanding language set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement establishing a 30 day waiting period, and will be deemed to have signed the full-time and promotion request lists and to have all rights available to an employee on such lists. Such an employee, however, may not bump an incumbent employee from a position but must await a vacancy which he may claim based on his seniority as provided for in the full-time and promotion request procedures. Pending a vacancy, the employee may be placed as a management trainee as defined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement or a Courtesy Clerk. Further, the employee must be employed for one continuous year in a store or facility covered by any Collective Bargaining Agreement with Local 7 immediately preceding the demotion or the employee shall be placed in the position of Courtesy Clerk.\n\n5. The Company may demote a management employee who is not a member of the bargaining unit into a management bargaining unit position of Head Clerk or above so long as such assignment does not circumvent the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\n6. When a reduction in the number of employees in a classification of Head Clerk and above is implemented, this procedure shall not apply, but rather the Letter of Understanding concerning layoff of bargaining unit management personnel shall be followed.","images":[{"name":"page_28.jpg","height":792,"width":612,"x":0,"y":0,"original_width":2473,"original_height":3200,"rotation":0,"type":"full_page_screenshot"},{"name":"page_28_text_1_v2.jpg","height":178.363,"width":478.477,"x":83.05,"y":444.674,"original_width":1934,"original_height":721,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_text_2_v2.jpg","height":108.384,"width":477.818,"x":83.699,"y":182.837,"original_width":1931,"original_height":438,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_text_3_v2.jpg","height":67.784,"width":478.752,"x":82.753,"y":306.737,"original_width":1935,"original_height":274,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_text_4_v2.jpg","height":40.057,"width":514.307,"x":47.226,"y":99.822,"original_width":2079,"original_height":162,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_text_5_v2.jpg","height":39.561,"width":478.685,"x":82.999,"y":389.707,"original_width":1935,"original_height":160,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_text_6_v2.jpg","height":39.928,"width":478.248,"x":83.255,"y":693.164,"original_width":1933,"original_height":162,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_text_7_v2.jpg","height":39.608,"width":478.275,"x":82.98,"y":638.207,"original_width":1933,"original_height":161,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_text_8_v2.jpg","height":25.945,"width":514.022,"x":47.107,"y":58.531,"original_width":2078,"original_height":105,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_text"},{"name":"page_28_footer_1_v2.jpg","height":7.609,"width":64.155,"x":494.103,"y":744.266,"original_width":260,"original_height":31,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_footer"},{"name":"page_28_number_1_v2.jpg","height":7.388,"width":10.576,"x":296.383,"y":744.352,"original_width":43,"original_height":30,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_number"},{"name":"page_28_footer_2_v2.jpg","height":6.997,"width":35.294,"x":523.116,"y":754.001,"original_width":143,"original_height":29,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_footer"},{"name":"page_28_paragraph_title_1_v2.jpg","height":11.168,"width":118.297,"x":70.414,"y":155.23,"original_width":479,"original_height":46,"rotation":0,"type":"layout_v2_paragraph_title"}],"charts":[],"items":[{"type":"text","md":"26                                                                  PUEBLO CLERKS\n                                                                    2022-2025","value":"26                                                                  PUEBLO CLERKS\n                                                                    2022-2025","bBox":{"x":494,"y":744,"w":64,"h":7,"confidence":0.8,"label":"footer"},"layoutAwareBbox":[{"x":494,"y":744,"w":64,"h":7,"startIndex":0,"endIndex":158,"confidence":0.8,"label":"footer"},{"x":523,"y":754,"w":35,"h":6,"startIndex":150,"endIndex":159,"confidence":0.68,"label":"footer"},{"x":296,"y":744,"w":10,"h":7,"startIndex":0,"endIndex":2,"confidence":0.5,"label":"number"}]},{"type":"text","md":"e.

In the event the parties are unable to reach agreement upon the selection of an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of the written request for arbitration, the party requesting arbitration may, with reasonable promptness, request a panel of seven (7) arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. From this panel of seven (7) names, each party shall alternately strike three (3) names, the moving party striking first. The remaining arbitrator from the list shall be the impartial arbitrator. A finding or award of the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive upon the parties hereto.\n\nSection 138. The arbitrator shall have all the rights, power, and duties herein given, granted and imposed upon him; but his award shall not change, alter or modify any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The expense of the impartial arbitrator shall be paid by the losing party. In the event neither party wins the total arbitration, the expenses shall be shared equally by the parties.\n\nThe arbitrator will issue his decision within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of the proceedings. This thirty (30) day calendar time limit may be extended by mutual agreement between both parties.\n\nSection 139. In the event either party refuses to arbitrate on demand of the other party, and an order compelling arbitration is obtained in Federal Court on the basis contended by the moving party, the refusing party will pay to the moving party reasonable legal fees incurred, up to Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).

The Union and Employer agree that notwithstanding any inclusion\nof a dollars-per-hour metric in the 5- star cake decorator matrix, this does not constitute a production\nstandard.\n\nThe Employer agrees that for those positions identified with a grandfathered rate on the attached wage\ntables, any individual who held a classification and rate so identified as of January 11, 2022, shall be\ngrandfathered during the term of this Agreement at fifty cents ($0.50) over the otherwise applicable wage\nrate, and shall receive the benefit of future increases.

At this point, the employee will receive credit for all hours\nworked with the company.

The Company shall designate the classification in its stores under these two general criteria:\n\n              a.     The sales volume of the Variety Department will be approximately $35,000 per week on\n                     a regular basis.\n\n              b.

Employees assigned to this new classification will be paid the new rate as of the date they are\n              assigned the position.\n\n       5.     The rate of pay will be $12.00/hour for Denver and all areas with similar rates.
