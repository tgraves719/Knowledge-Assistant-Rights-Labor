THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into by and between SAFEWAY INC.

The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining representative for all employees actively engaged in the handling and selling of merchandise, including part-time workers who work regularly one (1) day or more a week, employed by the Employer in the grocery store or stores owned or operated by the Employer in the metropolitan area of Pueblo, Colorado, but excluding all store managers, two assistant store managers per store, office and clerical employees, meat department employees, delicatessen department employees, demonstrators, watchmen, guards and professional employees and supervisors as defined in the National Labor Relations Act as amended.

Any new stores opened within the contractual boundaries of this contract shall be accreted to this Agreement.

All work and services performed in the bargaining unit connected with the handling or selling of merchandise to the public shall be performed exclusively by bargaining unit members except as provided below.

prevent the Employer from placing cash registers in the Deli Department of the store and from assigning the employees of such department to operate the register.

AUTHORIZED WORK FOR VENDORS

Section 3. Vendor Work: Direct store **delivery** vendors who deliver the product categories of beverages (including juice sold in produce/deli departments), cookies and crackers, bakery, pizza, ice cream, chips, specialty/gourmet/natural foods, **cosmetics, pet accessories,** greeting cards (and related products such as bows, wraps, candles, balloons, ribbons), newspapers, magazines, books and related products shall be allowed to perform all work in connection with the sale of their products directly delivered to the store. For purposes of this provision, the product categories as used herein shall be interpreted to include all products delivered by such vendor.

Additionally, all vendors shall be allowed to stock and otherwise maintain any J-Hook or Chip strip program. Additionally, all vendors may perform: any work in connection with promotional and seasonal displays; facing in connection with the service of product; rotation of product; cleaning of product, shelves and racks; affixing coupons and other promotional materials to products; vendors shall be permitted to perform three (3) major resets per store per section per calendar year. Additionally, vendors may perform work, as necessary to accommodate the introduction of new items, or removal of discontinued items, from the set; checking of code dates and removal of out-dated product; and any work in connection with the opening of a new store and the two (2) week period thereafter, or during the two (2) weeks before and after a store remodel. **All the product delivered to the store from a warehouse owned or operated by, or for the benefit of, the Employer shall be stocked by bargaining unit members with the above exceptions.**

The Employer agrees not to subcontract operations currently existing within the stores. Subcontracting is defined as a contractual relationship with another employer whereby employees of that employer perform the work of bargaining unit employees.

The Employer agrees that no employee classified as a Sanitation Clerk or Sanitation Manager on May 11, 1996 shall be laid-off or reduced in hours as a result of the subcontracting of floor care or expansion of Courtesy Clerk duties. However, the Employer reserves the right to promote Sanitation Clerks and/or Managers to All Purpose Clerk vacancies in order to provide for the use of outside contractors for floor maintenance and sanitation work. It is understood that before a full-time Sanitation Clerk is advanced to a full-time All Purpose Clerk position, such employee must have more seniority than the most senior employee on the All Purpose Clerk full-time list for the vacancy. It is understood that Sanitation Clerks protected herein may be assigned hours in lower classifications, at their sanitation rate, for purpose of meeting the job security provisions of this section.

## ARTICLE 4 CHECK-OFF

Section 8. The Employer agrees to deduct the weekly Union dues (including initiation fees for new employees) and uniform assessments from the net amount due each employee in the bargaining unit as described in Section 1 hereof who has furnished the Employer (either directly or through the Union) with an individual written authorization for making such deductions on a form mutually agreed upon between the Employer and the Union. It is understood that the check-off authorization is to be entirely voluntary upon the part of each such individual employee and that any such employee may revoke this individual check-off authorization upon giving thirty (30) days' written notice to the Employer and the Union.

Section 9. The Employer agrees to remit all such deductions to the President of the Local Union within ten (10) days after the last pay period of each month. The Union shall indemnify and hold the Employer harmless against any and all suits, claims, demands and liabilities which arise out of, or by reason of, any action which shall be taken by the Employer for the purpose of complying with provisions of this Article.

receive the appropriate rate for the new classification. The rate of pay for attendance at the Employer's off premise training school shall be no less than the minimum hourly rate set forth in the labor Agreement.

## ARTICLE 6
## RIGHTS OF MANAGEMENT

Section 13. The Employer retains the right to manage the store or stores, to direct the working forces, and to make necessary reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of business, providing that said rules and regulations are not in conflict with the terms of this Agreement in any way and to establish reasonable standards of dress (it is understood the Union reserves the right to arbitrate what is reasonable).

The Company retains the right to develop, implement and establish a Bonus Plan for Department Managers at its sole discretion including the right to determine bonus amounts, payment criteria, measurements and the right to make changes and modifications to the program including termination of the program.

# ARTICLE 10
# SCHEDULING AND ASSIGNMENT OF HOURS

Section 21. Work Schedules and Hours. Management retains the right to determine the number of hours, and start times of each shift, to be worked within each department and store. Daily scheduled shifts shall not be less than four (4) hours or more than eight (8) hours, at straight-time.

**Upon mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee, a full-time employee can be allowed to work four (4) ten (10) hour days to make up the standard workweek for full-time employees. Overtime will be computed for all hours worked over forty (40). Hours worked over eight (8) in a day will not apply to full-timers working the ten (10) hour shifts provided for herein. It is also understood that all other provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, including seniority rights, will be modified as applicable toward any ten (10) hour shifts the Employer may create in the individual store. During a holiday week, employees who have normally been scheduled four (4) ten (10) hour days may be scheduled four (4) or five (5) eight (8) hour days and will receive eight (8) hours holiday pay. Employees scheduled three (3) or four (4) ten (10) hour days in a holiday week shall receive ten (10) hours holiday pay.**

The Company will use its best efforts to give employees at least two (2) hours notice if an employee is required to work beyond the end of their scheduled shift. **No employee shall be subject to discipline for failure to remain at work beyond the end of his or her scheduled shift.**

Not later than ten (10) days prior to the start of any workweek, management shall post a list of shifts for each department. Non-management, employees shall be allowed to select their schedule from the posted list of shifts for which they are qualified to perform, in seniority order, within their department. Full-time employees shall select first, followed by part-time employees. No employee shall be allowed to select a schedule that will result in overtime or other penalty provision, unless expressly authorized by management. The employee's selection shall be recorded on a master work schedule. Employees shall not be permitted to select a portion of a shift. Prior to the start of the selection process, management shall identify approved vacation requests on the schedule.

                                                     2022-2025

Management may allow employees of one department to select shifts in another department. In this event, the employees must be qualified as defined herein, to perform the work of the other department. In addition, management reserves the right to assign, at its discretion, employees to, and designate the starting times of, any ordering shift.

Employees must immediately make their shift selections at the time directed by management. If an employee fails to promptly select, management shall select on behalf of the employee based on the employee's last written scheduling preference request. In this event, the employee waives all rights to grieve management's scheduling selection.

Unless otherwise approved, or as the result of a reduction in hours, no full-time employee shall select less than forty (40) hours and no part-time employee shall select less than twenty (20) hours per week.

Management may require junior employees to select a specific number of shifts so as to facilitate the selection of all shifts from the list. In the event an employee is left with less than minimum hours, but has not been zeroed out, management may pull shifts in reverse seniority order from senior employees to get such employee to minimum hours, or management may elect to zero such employee out and assign any remaining hours in seniority order to senior employees.

The master schedule must be completed and posted by 9:00 AM on Friday prior to the start of the next workweek. Such schedule shall not be changed by management for that workweek except where such change is predicated on circumstances beyond the control of management such as sickness, injury, leaves of absence, vacations, jury duty, funeral leave, significant fluctuations in sales volume, utility failure or Acts of God. Nothing in this section should be construed as preventing management from calling in employees for extra work outside of the posted schedule, from requiring overtime work outside of the posted schedule, or from bringing in additional employees where it appears advisable in the opinion of management. If the schedule is changed pursuant to this section, and hours are reduced, then the master schedule shall be re-bid downward, from the point of the schedule change. If hours are added, such hours shall be assigned as provided in the additional hours section of this Agreement.

Part-time Courtesy Clerks shall be scheduled for at least minimum hours <ins>unless otherwise agreed between the employee and management.</ins>

For purposes of this Article; non-management positions are defined as those below the level of Department Head, Assistant Department Head and Head Clerk. Time spent by employees selecting shifts shall not be considered compensable work time, but, notwithstanding, management may permit employees to select shifts on Company time. To be considered qualified, the employee must have worked in the job assignment for a minimum of six (6) months within the last two (2) years. However, employees shall be qualified for grocery/GM stocking or checking position if the employee has worked a minimum of three (3) months as a checker or stocker within the last three (3) years. Training hours, as designated by management, shall not be subject to selection by employees.

Section 22. Department Bidding. The Company shall allow during the first fifteen (15) days of February, to be effective the first workweek in March, and the first fifteen (15) days in August, to be effective the first workweek in September, non-management employees to bid within their classification and store to another department. Management retains the right to determine the number of full-time and part-time positions in each department. If a senior employee from a department bids into another department, the least senior employee in the classification and status affected shall be moved to the department vacated by the bidder. Employees may not

bid into a department if such bid will result in the displacement of a booth, dairy, service desk, order, produce or frozen food clerk, unless the bidding employee has been previously classified as, trained for and worked, for six (6) months or longer within the last two (2) years, such position. Produce clerks may not bid out of the produce department unless an employee with the same status, who is qualified as described herein, has requested bid into the produce department. The Employer agrees to provide training to qualify an employee to bid into another department as a grocery/GM stocker or as a checker.

Section 23. Additional Hours. Management shall post a weekly additional hours request list for their store/department. Employees interested in working additional hours must sign and designate the days they are interested in working additional hours on such list by midnight of the Saturday prior to the start of the applicable workweek.

When additional hours become available, management shall contact, in seniority order, employees who have requested to work on the day/shift indicated on the request list and offer them the hours. If the hours cannot be assigned to the employees requesting them, management may fill the hours at its discretion, including assigning those hours to employees who work in different Local 7 bargaining units within the same banner.

Prior to assigning hours to employees from outside the bargaining unit, employees in the home department/bargaining unit shall have priority in shift selections, if qualified. In the event available hours are being filled from outside the bargaining unit, the Company shall honor reasonable requests for training from employees within the bargaining unit who wish to claim such hours.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to require management to assign hours at overtime or to employees who have not made a request to work additional hours.

Bargaining Note: The intent of this provision is not to avoid assigning available hours to current department or bargaining unit employees or to avoid hiring for long term needs. Rather, the intent is to fill unexpected business needs.

The parties agree to meet at least every six (6) months to discuss issues which may arise from the implementation of this proposal.

Section 24. Temporary Advancement. When an employee is required to perform work in a higher classification, he shall receive the higher rate, based on his experience, but if required to perform work in a lower classification, he shall retain his regular rate, except in the case of actual demotion, when the employee shall receive pay according to his classification and experience.

Section 25. Reduction of Hours. Part-time Employees: If a part-time employee is zeroed out as a result of the selection of shifts, such employee shall be given layoff rights pursuant to the contract. However, if the average of all part-time employees within the classification and department is twenty-four (24) or more hours (including hours paid for vacation, sick, funeral, unworked holiday and jury duty pay) management may elect to pull hours, in reverse seniority order, from senior employees to maintain the bottom twenty percent (20%) (or three (3) employees whichever is greater) of employees within the classification and department at minimum weekly hours. An employee electing to displace pursuant to the layoff procedures shall assume the selected schedule of the employee he is bumping until he is able to select for the next workweek.

Full-time Employees: Management shall not write a schedule of shifts that would result in a full-time employee being unable to select a forty (40) hour schedule (thirty-two (32) hours in a holiday week) unless the average scheduled hours (including hours scheduled and paid for vacation, unworked holiday, jury, sick and funeral pay) of all part-time employees within the classification and department is twenty-four (24) hours or less

for the involved workweek. A full-time employee unable to select a forty (40) hour schedule, shall in their second consecutive week of such reduced hours, be allowed to exercise his/her seniority to claim the schedule of the least senior full-time employee in the classification within the bargaining unit who is working a forty (40) hour schedule. It is understood that the employee may exercise his/her seniority to bump any time between the second and eleventh week of reduction. The employee whose schedule is claimed under this procedure shall immediately be assigned the schedule of the claiming employee, or be allowed to step-down to part-time status and displace the least senior part-time employee in their store.

The parties agree that no employee assigned as full-time on May 11, 1996, shall have his hours reduced to less than forty (40) hours as the result of this provision, unless all part-time employees in the classification have had their scheduled hours reduced to twenty-four (24) hours or less. Such full-time employee shall have his hours reduced to twenty-four (24) or less before any other full-time employee protected under this paragraph is reduced.

Full-time Employees - Competitive Openings: During the first sixty (60) days following a competitive opening, management may elect, in lieu of reducing hours as provided above, to layoff full-time employees to maintain the same proportion of full-time employees to part-time employees the store averaged in the month prior to the competitive opening. In the event of a layoff, the displaced employee shall be given the following options:

1) Displace the least senior full-time employee in the bargaining unit, or

2) Step-down to part-time and displace the least senior part-time employee within the classification and store.

Employees displaced by the full-time reduction under this procedure shall be given their layoff options pursuant to the layoff language of this Agreement.

It is understood that the provisions of this section shall apply only to those classifications impacted by a competitive opening.

Such vacation pay in lieu of time off shall be paid out by January 31 of the calendar year after the election is made. Employees' earned vacation banks are capped at two times their annual accrual. If the accrual cap is reached, accrual will stop until the earned vacation bank falls back below the cap, at which point accrual will begin again.

However, in no event shall it be less than two (2) persons per retail bargaining unit and one (1) person per meat bargaining unit, except for any week of and the week before a holiday covered under this contract as well as Mother's Day and Valentine's Day, when the Employer may limit the number of people on vacation to no less than one (1) per bargaining unit. If a dispute develops between employees as to vacation preference, seniority shall govern within the department, the classification and store. Any vacation weeks that become available after the posting of such roster shall be offered by seniority within the classification and store.

The Employer will post a notice December 1 of the prior calendar year, and the employees will sign the roster as to their choice of vacation. This list will remain posted for selection until January 31 of each calendar year.

Any employee who fails to sign such roster prior to January 31, will be permitted to take vacation at a time that will not interfere with the other employees' established vacation period(s).

The Employer will then select employees, by seniority, within the classifications needed and implement the temporary transfer.

an employee (such as trading of hours) shall not be used for purposes of advancing an employee to full-time status. An employee who fails to maintain full-time status as a result of working less than forty (40) hours per week for reasons other than absence due to an approved leave of absence, or a reduced schedule resulting from an on-the-job injury for twelve (12) consecutive weeks shall be designated as a part-time employee.

The Employer agrees to an additional lookback at the beginning of year two (2) and year three (3) of the contract under the same terms. The Union agrees not to file any "4 at 40" grievances in the bargaining unit styled as Union All Affected during the life of the contract.**

Section 69. Assignment to Full-time Status. The Employer may transfer a full-time employee from another store to fill a vacancy in lieu of advancing an employee to full-time status under this Article.

Employees may sign the posting and be considered for promotion. **Upon completion of the seventy-two (72) hour period, management shall record the time it removed the posting and maintain a record of the posting for a period of no less than thirty (30) days.** The Company shall offer the promotion/**lateral transfer/full-time** to the senior qualified employee within both **the bargaining unit within the store, and, if none, then to the senior qualified employee within the store, and, if none, to the senior qualified employee not within the store, but within the bargaining unit**, prior to hiring off-the-street.

The Union shall have the right at any time between January 1 and January 31, 2023, to give written notice to the Employer that the trial has been unsuccessful. If the Union gives such notice, the parties agree to meet and discuss modifications to the procedures herein. After such meeting, the Employer shall have at least six (6) months to improve the procedures. If, after such time, the Union still has a good faith belief that the trial period has been unsuccessful, it may provide written notice within one (1) month of the expiration of the six (6) month period. If that occurs, the Employer shall have one (1) month to revert to the procedures for promotion, lateral transfer, and promotion to full-time status previously contained in this Section prior to the modifications herein.

Upon attaining age 18, employees who were passed over shall be promoted as per their request on the Promotion Request List whenever an appropriate position becomes available.**

Section 72. Probationary Period For Promotions. When any employee is promoted to a higher classification, he shall be on probation for thirty (30) calendar days if full-time, forty-five (45) calendar days if part-time. If an employee is unsuccessful during probation, the employee will be returned to his prior classification with regard to position and status.

In the event an employee transfers from one area in the Denver Division of Safeway, or is reinstated from another Division of Safeway within thirty (30) days as per Safeway's Reinstatement Policy, to a bargaining unit in the jurisdiction of Local No. 7, then all continuous employment seniority with the Company shall be recognized by both the Union and the Company after thirty (30) days in the bargaining unit to which the employee transfers or is reinstated.**

**It is agreed that this provision shall become effective, and seniority dates shall be adjusted as soon as administratively possible, for all employees who have previously transferred or been reinstated from another Division of Safeway into a Local 7 bargaining unit.**

**The parties agree that when seniority date adjustments become necessary, as a result of this Agreement, that the adjustments shall be made as quickly as possible within the terms of the respective Contract.**

employee's scheduled hours can be extended or part-time employees may be called in without overtime penalty. Hours unclaimed under this procedure may be assigned in reverse order of seniority among those employees within the department within the classification within the store present when the need for overtime arises.

Overtime assignments of four (4) hours or more may be filled by calling in employees, in seniority order, within the classification and the department on their non-scheduled day without violating this Section.

## ARTICLE 29 LAYOFFS

Section 77. Layoffs. When a reduction in the workforce is necessary, as opposed to a reduction in hours, the following procedure shall be used:

Layoff will begin in departments (checker, day stocker, night stocker and produce for All-Purpose Clerk classification) in the classification to be affected in reverse seniority order. The affected person shall be notified and given the following options:

(a) Displacing a less senior employee in the same classification in the store, if the affected employee is qualified for such position.

The affected employee shall be given his/her layoff options immediately upon his/her release to work.

(e) If within the first eight weeks of operation of the new store the Employer determines that it needs to lay off employees from that store, said layoffs will take place in accordance with Article 29, except that employees who have transferred into the new store shall have the right to return to their prior store.

Section 78. In the event of a layoff or reduction in hours, employees who have been "specially trained" in the area of Cake Decorators, FTD Florists, Head Baker and/or Assistant Bakery Manager and Postal Clerks may only be replaced by a more senior employee who has worked at least six months in the "specially trained" classification.

Employees will be considered "specially trained" provided they meet the qualifications and guidelines below.

**IV.** The Dairy and Frozen Food full-time positions that are being vacated by persons classified as head clerks shall remain full-time positions at the time of reclassification and shall be filled by all-purpose clerks in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

**V.** It is understood and agreed that hours being vacated by head clerks or above, except GM Managers, shall become all-purpose clerk hours and will be used to create as many full-time positions as is possible. It is understood and agreed that the Company retains the right to employ part-time head clerks.

**VI.** This settlement agreement shall apply to all collective bargaining agreements between Safeway Stores, Inc. and Local No. 7 in Colorado and shall have a term co-existent with the current collective bargaining agreements.

**Section 80. Layoff Procedures, applicable only to Colorado Springs retail clerks and meat bargaining units.** Clarifies layoff procedures on Section 77 of the retail clerks contract and Section 97 of the retail meat contract for Colorado Springs.

**1.** This agreement pertains to the implementation of layoff procedures in Section 97 of the retail meat contract and Section 77 of the retail clerks contract for the Colorado Springs bargaining units.

**2.** The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that to the greatest extent possible in circumstances when multiple layoffs are necessary, the Company will operate the layoff procedures in Section 97 (retail meat) and Section 77 (retail clerks) so that the least senior employees in the bargaining unit will be the employees who are laid off. Therefore, the Company will discontinue its current practice. Instead, the Company will complete the process of offering and having the employee choose the layoff options with the first affected employee before going to the second affected employee, then will complete the layoff options with the second affected employee before going to the next employee, and so forth.

**3. Time limit for exercising options.** When a reduction in the work force is necessary, the Company will notify the affected employee of his/her options in accordance with Section 97 of the retail meat contract of Section 77 of the retail clerks contract. If the affected person is notified of his/her layoff options before 11:00 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company's designated representative (the district secretary, store manager, or other person handling the matter for the Company) of his/her chosen option by no later than 4:00 p.m. on the same day. If the affected person is notified of his/her options after 11:00 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company's representative of the chosen option by 8:30 a.m. on the next day. These are outside time limits, and the affected person is free to inform the Company of which option he/she chooses sooner than these time limits.

**4. Effect of not exercising option within time limits.** If the affected person does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits set forth above, the affected person will be deemed to have exercised the first option specified in Section 97 (retail meat) or Section 77 (retail clerks) that is available, assuming that the affected person qualifies for such option when the contract requires qualifications. For example, if a retail clerk employee does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits, he/she will be deemed to have chosen the option in Section 77 of displacing a less senior employee within the same classification in the store

**or, if such option is unavailable, of displacing the least senior employee within the same classification in the bargaining unit.**

Section 81. Employees Accepting a Lower Classification. Laid off employees, and employees who accept a job in a lower classification in lieu of layoff, shall be recalled as needed, in order of seniority, to jobs they are qualified to perform. Employees recalled from layoff may refuse recall if the store being offered is more than ten (10) miles from their previous store (i.e., the employee will maintain recall rights). The Company shall provide employees with a form, at time of layoff, to indicate their desires in this regard. It is understood that employees may change this election during a layoff. However, the changes and/or refusals shall be limited to two (2) per layoff. The Employer shall not hire a new employee or promote an existing employee into a position for which a laid off employee or employee who accepts a job in a lower classification is qualified and available to perform.

Section 82. Employees Accepting Layoff. An employee accepting a layoff, rather than accepting a job in a lower classification, may inform the Employer in writing at the time of the layoff of his desire to be recalled to a lower classification and such notification shall be honored when a vacancy occurs. Employees recalled from layoff may refuse recall if the store being offered is more than ten (10) miles from their previous store (i.e., the employee will maintain recall rights). The Company shall provide employees with a form, at time of layoff, to indicate their desires in this regard. It is understood that employees may change this election during a layoff. However, the changes and/or refusals shall be limited to two (2) per layoff. The notice shall specify the lower classification to which the employee desires recall. It is understood that any employee on layoff from the classification where the vacancy occurs shall have preferential rights to such vacancy.

Whenever a full-time employee is laid off, in accordance with the collective-bargaining agreement, and is recalled to a part-time schedule at a store different than the one the employee was laid off from, the following procedures will apply:

a. The employee will be notified that he or she can accept the position, working reduced hours, or can stay on layoff until a full-time position within the bargaining unit is available. The employee will also be notified that if the employee remains on layoff for a period of nine (9) months or twelve (12) months, whichever is applicable, the employee's seniority will be terminated. The Company will have the employee sign a form acknowledging that he or she was informed of the same or will send a letter confirming this fact to the employee.

b. If the employee accepts the part-time position, he or she will retain his or her full-time status unless he or she is scheduled and works less than forty (40) hours per week for twelve (12) consecutive weeks. If the employee works, or is scheduled forty (40) hours during any of the twelve (12) consecutive weeks, that employee will not have his or her hours reduced unless and until the Company has followed the reduction in hours provision of the contract. If an employee works or is scheduled forty (40) hours, the twelve (12) week period will start over. Further, if a forty (40) hour position becomes available, it will be offered, in seniority order, to full-time employees on layoff and full-time employees working reduced hours before a new employee is hired or an existing employee is granted full-time status.

c. If an employee is reclassified as part-time, he or she will be immediately placed on the full-time request list, in accordance with his or her seniority, without regard to bid periods.

d. The full-time employees working reduced hours shall be able to utilize the second (2nd) week bump as set forth in the collective-bargaining agreement.

e. Employees working reduced hours shall be able to maximize their hours in accordance with the applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

Section 83. Courtesy Clerk Options. The above notwithstanding, the options of a Courtesy Clerk shall be limited to displacing the shortest service Courtesy Clerk in that store or accepting the layoff. (Courtesy Clerks with three (3) or more years of service may displace the least senior Courtesy Clerk in the bargaining unit.)

## Section 84. Demotions.

1. If a member of the bargaining unit classified as a Head Clerks or above is demoted, voluntarily or involuntarily, and has been employed in the bargaining unit for a minimum of one continuous year prior to the demotion, the employee may be returned to the classification and status, full-time or part-time, when first promoted to the bargaining unit position of Head Clerk or above. In returning the employee to the position previously held, the least senior employee in the classification and status may be bumped as a result. Further, the Company may demote the employee to a bargaining unit management position as long as the assignment does not circumvent the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

2. If a member of the bargaining unit classified as a Head Clerk or above is demoted, voluntarily or involuntarily, and has been employed in the bargaining unit for a minimum of one continuous year prior to the demotion, but has not held a non-management position in the bargaining unit, he may claim a position as if he had signed the full-time or promotion request lists and may bump the junior incumbent employee based on seniority.

3. If a member of the bargaining unit classified as Head Clerk of above is demoted voluntarily or involuntarily, and has not been employed in the bargaining unit for one continuous year prior to the demotion, the employee shall be placed in the position of a Courtesy Clerk.

4. If a management employee who is not a member of the bargaining unit is demoted, voluntarily or involuntarily, into a non-management bargaining unit position, the employee may exercise full Company seniority from the date of such demotion, notwithstanding language set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement establishing a 30 day waiting period, and will be deemed to have signed the full-time and promotion request lists and to have all rights available to an employee on such lists. Such an employee, however, may not bump an incumbent employee from a position but must await a vacancy which he may claim based on his seniority as provided for in the full-time and promotion request procedures. Pending a vacancy, the employee may be placed as a management trainee as defined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement or a Courtesy Clerk. Further, the employee must be employed for one continuous year in a store or facility covered by any Collective Bargaining Agreement with Local 7 immediately preceding the demotion or the employee shall be placed in the position of Courtesy Clerk.

5. The Company may demote a management employee who is not a member of the bargaining unit into a management bargaining unit position of Head Clerk or above so long as such assignment does not circumvent the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

6. When a reduction in the number of employees in a classification of Head Clerk and above is implemented, this procedure shall not apply, but rather the Letter of Understanding concerning layoff of bargaining unit management personnel shall be followed.

## ARTICLE 30
## TRANSFER FROM STORE TO STORE

Section 85. Transfers from Store to Store. Transfers from store to store shall not be made or denied for capricious, arbitrary or discriminatory reasons. Employees desiring a transfer to another store within the bargaining unit, in order to be near their residence, may indicate their desire for transfer in writing to their Store Manager. Such transfer requests will be considered at the time an opening occurs within their classification and status.

## ARTICLE 31
## NEW STORE LANGUAGE

Section 86. In the event of the opening of a new store within the bargaining unit (including a replacement of an existing store), the following procedure shall apply:

1. At least four (4) weeks prior to the opening of a new store, the Employer will post a sheet in each location for interested employees to sign if desirous of a transfer to the new location. The sheet shall remain posted for at least ten (10) days.

2. Job openings either at the new store or created by transferring employees at their former store shall first be filled by employees on layoff in the classification of the vacancy before any new employees are hired or current employees are promoted.

3. Employees who have signed the new store transfer request sheet shall be given consideration based on their qualifications and the requirements of the store. It is understood that the Employer may move employees from its own competitive stores which may be impacted by the new store opening before consideration of other employee desires.

4. In the event the Employer opens new stores within the geographical area of this Agreement, as set forth in Article 1, not less than sixty percent (60%) of the initial staffing of the new store shall be made by employees covered by this bargaining Agreement, if available.

The "up to" rates for **2023 and 2024** will be determined as following:

1. Using the latest financial data available as of **each September (or most recently available data in preparation for the December fund meeting)**, co-consultants will develop a forecast through 12/31/2024.

2. In preparing the forecast, the below trend rates will be used.

3. If the forecast projects an ending balance at 12/31/**2024** that is below the target reserve level (average of 1.4 months of expense for the 12 months ending 12/31/**2024**, plus IBNR at 12/31/**2024**), then the employer contributions will be increased effective January **2023** and **2024** so that the ending reserve will be equal to the target reserve. **Any projected deficit in the ending balance shall first be corrected by increasing the 2023 employer contribution rates until such rates reach the "up to" levels for 2023.** In no event will the increase in the employer contributions rates exceed **5.0% in 2023 or 2024.** In no event will the **"up to"** employer contribution rates be less than the **prior year's** employer contribution rate.

4. Co-consultants will work together to develop increases that are as close as possible. In the event co-consultants develop materially different estimates, the lowest increase will be implemented while Trustees resolve the differences between the two estimates of the co-consultants. Any arbitration concerning the differences between the two estimates shall be held not more than sixty (60) days following deadlock.

persons who are not included in the enrollment data, or where a claim for payment has been submitted by or on behalf of such person.

The Fund will audit its enrollment and claims records at least once within each 24 month period to ensure that no employees of the Employer, or the dependents of such employees, are participating in plan coverage for which they are not eligible and to ascertain that claims and other plan expenses are being paid in accordance with the Plan's provisions.

Initial Eligibility – Part-time employees hired before March 27, 2005 who on March 26, 2005, have met the initial eligibility requirement for benefits under the Trust will continue to be eligible for coverage provided the employee enrolls in the Plan beginning in 2005, and further provided the employee has made the required employee co-premium payment.

Employees who were eligible for and were participating in Plan B on March 26, 2005, shall participate in Plan B until such employee has been covered under such Plan B for 24 months. Thereafter, such employee may advance to Plan A provided they continue to enroll and meet the eligibility requirements of the Plan. Employees hired on or before March 26, 2005, who are not eligible for coverage as of March 26, 2005 shall be required to meet initial eligibility for Plan B, and subsequent eligibility to begin participation in Plan A, as provided in the predecessor agreement which terminated in 2004.

Upon completion of the first (36) months of eligibility under Plan C, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll in Plan B for the next (36) months of eligibility under Plan B. Thereafter, provided the employee continues to maintain eligibility, such employee and their eligible dependents may enroll and participate in Plan A.

Full-time employees (excluding Courtesy Clerks) shall on the first of the month following 3 months of employment, be eligible to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan B, and after (36) months of eligibility under Plan B, shall be allowed to enroll with their eligible dependents in Plan A.

---



to enhance the goal of improving health status a series of incentives must be developed.

There is recognition that incentives may take various forms and will likely evolve and change over time based on program experience with a goal of maximizing program effectiveness and reducing health costs and medical trend. The initial focus will be a thorough educational campaign in connection with program roll out.

4. Establish free and/or reduced cost educational programs such as:

    a. Weight management
    b. Smoking cessation
    c. High Cholesterol

5. Reduce prescription drug co-pays as shown below for participants taking maintenance drugs (and related supplies which require a prescription) for certain disease states which would include categories of drugs such as:

## Long Term Funding Policy

1. The parties recommend to the trustees that a Minimum Reserve Requirement be established equal to IBNR reserves plus a lag month reserve. The Fund consultants shall calculate the IBNR and lag month reserve requirement at least once every twelve months beginning on (date) and report these amounts to the Trustees at their next regularly scheduled meeting. Any withdrawing employer shall reimburse the Fund for their participants claims run off.

2. If the market value of the assets at any twelve-month review point is ever below the calculated IBNR level as calculated by the Fund consultants, then the Fund consultants shall prepare recommendations for benefit plan redesign and/or employee co-premium contributions such that the dollar amount of any such deficiency will be fully recovered by the end of the 12-month period beginning after the trustee meeting in which the deficiency is first projected.

3. No changes are permitted that would violate any contractual agreement between the Fund and any third party vendor.

4. If the Fund consultants cannot agree on a recommended plan of benefit redesign and/or employee co-premium contributions, and the Trustees cannot agree to a corrective action plan, by virtue of deadlock motions, then the trustees must act to adopt the recommended corrective action plan that has the least adverse impact on plan participants, however, one set of Trustees may exercise the Fund's dispute resolution procedure on an expedited basis to determine if other corrective actions must be taken.

5. The minimum reserve target defined above is solely meant to be a "floor". It is not also a "ceiling". That is, no Trustee action is required or expected in the event that reserve levels are above the minimum reserve target.

In the event the parties are unable to reach agreement upon the selection of an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of the written request for arbitration, the party requesting arbitration may, with reasonable promptness, request a panel of seven (7) arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. From this panel of seven (7) names, each party shall alternately strike three (3) names, the moving party striking first. The remaining arbitrator from the list shall be the impartial arbitrator. A finding or award of the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive upon the parties hereto.

Section 140. Safeway Inc. and the UFCW Union Local No. 7 agree to enter into this Agreement to selectively use mediation to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution of certain formal grievances.

The following procedure will be followed whenever a grievance is selected to be mediated:

1. Once a grievance has been requested for arbitration, the parties may agree to submit the grievance to a mediator. The parties shall use a mutually agreed upon mediator.

a) The parties will contact the mediator and schedule a date for the mediation conference to be held on a monthly basis effective immediately.

b) The grievant and location manager shall be present for the conference. Each party shall be permitted to have not more than two additional observers. Observers shall not be permitted to offer testimony or make oral statements.

c) The proceedings shall be informal and the formal rules of evidence shall not apply. Each party will make a brief presentation of the facts of their case not to exceed 15 minutes. The Grievant and Location Manager may also make an oral explanation of their case not to exceed five minutes. The parties may also submit other written evidence, statements, etc., to the mediator, witnesses and oral testimony, provided that such testimony does not exceed the 20-minute total set forth above.

d) The mediator will have the authority to meet with each party separately and to recommend a reasonable settlement to the grievance. The mediator shall have the authority to compel the resolution of the grievance. Grievances ruled upon or settled shall be considered final and binding and may not be further processed to arbitration.

e) All settlements or rulings shall be on a non-precedent setting basis and without prejudice to either party, except settlements may specifically provide otherwise.

f) The parties agree to attempt to schedule multiple grievances per mediation conference. Further, the parties agree to share expenses of the mediator.

This agreement shall be effective on the date of execution of this agreement and may be cancelled by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.

Section 141. EXPEDITED ARBITRATION PROCEDURES

Effective upon ratification of this agreement, the parties signatory below agree to adopt an expedited arbitration procedure as outlined below. Notwithstanding the provisions of such agreement, the parties recognize that arbitrations already scheduled prior to the effective date of this agreement shall be arbitrated as in the past and not subject to the provisions of this agreement unless the parties mutually agree to do so.

A mutually agreed upon arbitrator shall be selected to hear cases arising under this procedure. The parties will direct the arbitrator to set aside one day per month to hear arbitrations under his procedure. As near as practical, such dates will be during the second or fourth week of each month. If necessary, and the parties mutually agree, the arbitrators will be asked to set aside more days per month.

                                                      2022-2025

The parties shall attempt to meet biweekly to review cases pending arbitration and to schedule cases for arbitration under this procedure. Should a case scheduled for arbitration be settled prior to the scheduled date, the parties will make an earnest effort to substitute another case for the scheduled date.

Except as otherwise set forth in this agreement, all discipline cases, including discharges, shall be subject to the provisions of this procedure. Contract interpretation cases, upon mutual agreement by both parties, shall also be subject to this procedure. For discipline cases, other than discharges, both parties agree, where practical, to schedule at least two such cases to be heard on one day, with the understanding that the presentation of such cases shall not exceed four hours, with both sides being allocated two hours for the presentation of their case and cross-examination of witnesses of the opposing side.

For all discipline cases, including discharges, both parties will make closing oral arguments unless mutually agreed otherwise, and the arbitrator will issue a brief written award. Where practical, the parties will direct the arbitrator to issue a written bench decision and summarize his decision in a one-page letter following the arbitration. The arbitrator, at his discretion, may request no more than seven days to deliberate on the issues of a particular case. In this regard, an arbitrator will issue his award within fourteen days following the close of the hearing.

Both parties will direct the arbitrator to issue an abbreviated, which details only the arbitrator's award and a brief explanation as to the reasons for this award. In the case of contract interpretive matters, both parties recognize the need to file briefs and have the arbitrator write a detailed decision. In this regard, both parties agree to file briefs within two weeks following the close of the hearing and will direct the arbitrator to issue an abbreviated decision which details only the arbitrator's award within two weeks following the receipt of briefs. The arbitrator will then issue a detailed decision within thirty days following receipt of the briefs by the parties.

Either party may, by notification to the other prior to a case being scheduled, exclude a particular case from the provisions of this agreement. In this case, the arbitration shall be scheduled and handled under the normal procedure.

Provisions of this agreement are hereby entered into by both parties signatory below and in full force and effect, unless either party, through written notification to the other party, gives thirty (30) days written notice of their intent to cancel this agreement. In this regard, the parties agree that cases scheduled for arbitration under this procedure shall proceed to arbitration as provided above.

## Section 142

**1. The parties recognize that the information requests that routinely accompany grievances filed by Local 7 can be burdensome and time consuming for the Company to respond to, which in turn impacts the effective and efficient administration of the grievance procedure. Accordingly, Local 7 has committed to reviewing the information requests it has accompanying pending grievances as well as information requests it may file with future grievances to determine whether the information requests can appropriately be withdrawn or tailored more narrowly in scope.**

**2. The parties also agree to schedule monthly settlement meetings at which the parties will discuss the possible settlement or withdrawal of grievances pending arbitration.**

**3. The parties will work from an agenda containing cases pending arbitration ranked in order of date filed with the exception that cases involving termination, demotion, or potential continuing liability shall be moved to the top of the agenda in date order and shall be discussed before any other case.

b. Cases that are continued at the monthly settlement meeting pending further review or investigation shall remain on the agenda for discussion at future monthly settlement meetings.

c. Cases that have been discussed but not resolved may, at the option of the grieving party, be scheduled for arbitration as provided below.

5. Grievances referred to arbitration shall be placed in the scheduling queue and scheduled for hearing as follows:

b. The party requesting arbitration shall promptly request a panel of arbitrators from FMCS for each case placed in the scheduling queue.

c. Within sixty (60) days after a final settlement meeting decision, the parties will select an arbitrator.

d. The parties will use best efforts to schedule the hearing in the matter for which an arbitrator has been appointed within six (6) months following a final settlement meeting decision with the understanding that the parties may schedule a hearing a date later than six (6) months upon mutual agreement or as the result of 6(e) below.

e. Notwithstanding the provisions of 6(d) above, neither party shall be required or obligated to schedule more than three (3) cases per calendar month except by mutual agreement.

f. In all disciplinary cases referred to arbitration, as a condition to accepting appointment, the arbitrator must agree to render a decision and award no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the parties' post hearing statements. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, such statements must be filed no later than fourteen (14) days following the close of the hearing (or receipt of transcript where applicable) and must be limited to no more than ten (10) single space letter size pages. It is specifically agreed and understood that any such case resolved under this procedure shall be deemed "nonprecedential" and will not be cited by either party in any future proceeding. The provisions of this subsection (e) may be modified on a case by case basis by mutual agreement of the parties.

The Company's Director of Labor Relations and the Union President will retain jurisdiction over this letter of understanding and may, by mutual agreement, modify this letter of understanding as they deem necessary and appropriate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agreements' grievance and arbitration process. Any such modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties.

The employee shall advise management anytime after the next schedule is finalized for the workweek of their desire to exercise their right to work the hours due during the workweek on the date and time determined by the employee. An aggrieved employee may not demand such remedy on an overtime or premium-pay basis if the alleged violation occurred on what would have been a straight-time day for such employee. The employee must exercise this right to work within four (4) weeks of the settlement of error with the employee or such right shall be forfeited and no further remedy shall be required.

## ARTICLE 47 NO STRIKE OR LOCKOUT

The employee must notify the Employer, in writing, within seven (7) days after receiving such notification of the store closing or of the store being sold.

The Employer shall pay said dislocation and training pay to the employees prior to the effective date of the store closing.

However, the Employer will only be required to make two (2) months Health and Welfare contributions following termination and the Employer will not be required to make any Pension contributions.

Any employee who requests said dislocation and training pay shall not be entitled to any other provisions as set forth in Article 48.

3-6 months equals fifty percent (50%) of a week's pay.
6-9 months equals seventy-five percent (75%) of a week's pay.

# TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES

Section 161. The parties recognize that a well-trained workforce is beneficial to employer and employees alike.

In the event the Employer introduces technological changes that impact bargaining unit work, they shall meet to discuss the changes, their anticipated impact on the workforce, and any other subjects relating to or arising from the technological change in question and the affected employees.

In addition, the Employer agrees to discuss the following:

iii. In the event the employee is not retrained or transferred and is separated from employment as a result of technological changes, the Company and the Union will discuss using a placement service.

iv. To the extent that technological change results in the loss of bargaining unit work or positions, the Employer shall discuss implementing such change gradually, to allow for the natural attrition of employees through voluntary separation or retirement, with the intention that no employee, who is employed as of the date the Employer notifies the Union of its anticipated technological change, is involuntarily separated from their employment.

In the event the employee is not retrained or transferred and is permanently displaced as a direct result of major technological changes as defined above, the employee will be eligible for severance pay in accordance with the following provisions:

Appendix "A"

The minimum hourly rates of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.

**Bargaining Note: Although the parties have agreed to move certain classifications to the same rate, it is expressly understood and agreed that selection of shifts will be done separately in each department, and that additional hours will be offered to other employees in a given department prior to being offered to other employees in the bargaining unit. The Union and Employer agree that notwithstanding any inclusion of a dollars-per-hour metric in the 5-star cake decorator matrix, this does not constitute a production standard.**

**The Employer agrees that for those positions identified with a grandfathered rate on the attached wage tables, any individual who held a classification and rate so identified as of January 11, 2022, shall be grandfathered during the term of this Agreement at fifty cents ($0.50) over the otherwise applicable wage rate, and shall receive the benefit of future increases. This rate is reflected on the attached wage charts as "grandfathered."**

## Basket Hours

**When an employee (not at the "thereafter" rate) is promoted from a lower classification to a higher classification, the employee's wage shall remain the same or be advanced to the next higher wage rate if the rate does not exist in their new classification. At this point, the employee will receive credit for all hours worked with the company and those hours will determine their pay level in the new classification. The employee will then work the necessary hours in that step before receiving their next pay increase.**

**When an employee (at the "thereafter" rate) is promoted from a lower classification to a higher classification, the employee's wage shall remain the same or be advanced to the step below the "thereafter" rate in their new job class, whichever is higher. At this point, the employee will receive credit for all hours worked with the company. The employee will then be required to work the last progression step of hours before moving into the "thereafter" rate in their new role.**

**Similarly, an employee that moves from a higher classification to a lower classification, except an employee moving to meat cutter, will receive credit for all hours worked with the company and those hours will determine their pay level in the new classification (even if this results in a decrease in pay).**

**Notwithstanding the above, when an associate promotes to Senior Certified Pharmacy Technician, they will start on the first step and work the hours associated with each step to advance.**

**Bargaining Note: The parties intend this provision to apply in all circumstances where an employee changes job classification within the Company, including lateral transfers (for example, APC to Produce Clerk), step-downs (for example, Assistant Deli Manager to Deli Clerk), and transfers between bargaining units (for example, Coffee Clerk to Customer Service Clerk).**

SAFEWAY INC. CLERKS LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING

## 1. C-5 Employees reinstated under terms of Alcohol Rehabilitation Program. Agreement reached as a result of a meeting held on March 31, 1983, between Charles Mercer and Rex Berry.

As a result of a meeting held on March 31, 1983 between Charles Mercer and Rex Berry, the following terms and conditions have been agreed upon regarding future letters of agreement concerning employees re-instated under the terms of our Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program.

1. The employee must enroll in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program recognized by the State and/or Federal Government.

2. The employee must sign a release which permits Safeway Stores, Inc. and Retail Clerks Union, Local 7 access to any and all information related to his/her treatment required by, or undertaken in, the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program. Safeway Stores, Inc. has the right in its discretion, to obtain status reports from the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program Organization.

3. Any employee terminated from Safeway Stores, Inc. for any reason, who later claims to be an alcoholic, will not be entitled to any back pay should the employee be reinstated under this policy.

4. The Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program shall not in any way interfere with the written work schedule at the employee's place of employment.

5. Any employee enrolled in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program is still subject to progressive discipline for any infraction of Safeway Stores, Inc. rules, regulations, or policies, and remains subject to the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

6. Safeway Stores, Inc. shall not be liable for any expense associated with an employee's enrollment in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program.

7. Should an employee violate any provision of the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the Company and the union will review the violation to determine if there are any highly unusual circumstances which might warrant continuation in the program. If there are no such circumstances, the employee shall be terminated immediately.

8. Upon enrolling in the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the employee shall be reinstated, but the employee will not necessarily be assigned his/her place of employment from which he/she was terminated. Safeway Stores, Inc. reserves the right to reinstate an employee to a place of employment which best serves the operational interest of Safeway Stores, Inc.

9. Reinstatement shall be no later than two full weeks after the agreement is signed, or two full weeks after a "dry-out period", if required by the treating physician.

10. An employee terminated under the provisions of the Absentee Program who is later reinstated under the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program will return to work under the provisions of the Absentee Program at the same level and status which prevailed at the time of termination.

11. Once an employee has successfully completed an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program under this policy, the employee shall not be entitled to the benefits of this policy a second time.

2. C-14 Procedure for Scheduling Employees with Conscientious Objections to Working on Their Day of Sabbath. Unsigned and undated agreement between Safeway and UFCW Local 7.

## PROCEDURE FOR SCHEDULING EMPLOYEES WITH CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO WORKING ON THEIR DAY OF SABBATH

We have had a number of requests for the procedure in the handling of employees scheduled on a day which is their day of Sabbath. Safeway has entered into an agreement with UFCW which provides certain procedures for accommodating individuals who have such conscientious objections.

Problems can result in a grievance under the contract as well as a possible violation of the laws against discrimination on the basis of religion, so please follow these procedures carefully and call Safeway Inc. Human Resources if necessary.

This procedure, of course, applies only to any employee who advised you:

1. that they have conscientious objections to working a particular day of the week.

2. the nature of their conscientious objections, and

3. the particular day of the week which they are unable to work.

If you have any questions concerning whether the employee actually has bona fide conscientious objections, be certain to contact Employee Relations and review the matter. You also should complete the form attached to these instructions, ask the employee to sign it, and route it to Safeway Inc. Human Resources Department for future reference.

The procedure for scheduling is as follows:

1. Until noon on Saturday for the following week's schedule an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with any employee junior to him in the same job classification in the store which will result in the employee obtaining their Sabbath as a day off. You may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail, and the junior employee cannot refuse to make the trade.

2. As an option, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with a senior employee who is willing to make such an exchange. Again, you may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail and the senior employee may refuse to make the trade.

3. As a third alternative, an employee may simply decline to work on their day of Sabbath if they cannot trade shifts with anyone else. Such an employee will not be disciplined under the Absenteeism Program except for failure to notify the Company prior to a scheduled shift that he

---



will not work on their day of Sabbath. You will then assess points for failure to call, but not for the absence itself.

4. If an employee cannot make a change of shifts and is scheduled on their day of Sabbath for the entire bid period or for any extended period of time, it is permissible for that employee to advise you at the beginning of the bid period or other extended period of time that they will not work on such day for the entire three months. <ins>Such an employee, if full-time, will not in fact be scheduled 40 hours, but 32 hours. The Company has no obligation to provide 40 hours work under these circumstances.</ins>

Attached you will find a form for keeping a record of any such scheduling accommodation.

It is very important that we follow these procedures and complete the attached form in the event we are challenged on our application of the settlement agreement.

## 3. News Media and RTUI (Placement of Signs upon Shopping Carts). (All Safeway Bargaining Units in Colorado).

1. Representatives from News Media and RTUI (or an alternative vendor), may maintain advertising space on aisle vision billboards, shopping carts, and the shelf-talker instant coupon machine in all stores, with the understanding that such advertising placards are not to include pricing of any kind.

2. It is further understood that this work is strictly limited as described above and shall not be expanded further.

3. The Company will provide the Union with a copy of the current contract with News Media and RTUI and will, upon request, provide a copy of future contracts.

4. The term of this letter of understanding is concurrent with the present collective bargaining agreements, effective from 2019-2022. Either party may choose to terminate this letter of understanding when such agreements expire.

## 4. Estes Park Store SW 920 (Retail Clerks Contract). Transfers of Employees from Outside the Unit. Clarifies seniority rights for Head Clerks and other management employees who transfer into this store. Signed by Bruce Trull for Safeway on 12-19-94 and Michael Belo for UFCW Local 7 on 1-3-95.

1. This agreement pertains to the interpretation of Article 27, Section 63, which provides as follows, in relevant part: "Seniority for employees who transfer into the store from another bargaining unit will begin on the first (1st) day they work in the Estes Park store, except the Company shall have the right to transfer a maximum of one (1) employee per bargaining unit per year into the store who shall retain their original seniority date with the Employer after they have worked for six (6) consecutive months in the Estes Park store."

2. A dispute has arisen between the Union and the Employer about whether the above provision applies to transfers of head clerks or to transfers of other management employees who are included in the bargaining unit or, even if not included in the unit when transferred, are demoted or step down into the bargaining unit after their transfer. The parties agree to resolve the dispute as set forth below.

3. In the event that the Employer transfers head clerks or other management employees into the Estes Park store, such employees will have seniority from the date they begin working in the Estes Park store until two years have passed. After two years of working continuously in the store, such employees will regain their company seniority, i.e., length of continuous employment with the Employer. This two-year waiting period shall apply to transfers of head clerks, other bargaining unit management employees, and non-bargaining unit management employees who are demoted or step down into the bargaining unit. This restriction on seniority does not apply to qualifications for the number of weeks of vacation (but does apply to scheduling of vacations) or other non-competitive benefits for which continuous employment with the Employer is the requirement.

4. Before transferring head clerks or other bargaining unit management employees into the Estes Park store, the Employer will first notify Estes Park employees of the position and will consider any Estes Park employees who have applied for the position. The Employer will have full discretion, however, to decide whether or not to select an Estes Park employee for the position.

## Employee Buyout

The Employer, at its discretion, may establish a buyout program as follows:

1. Employees with ten (10) or more years of service who elect this buyout by a date determined by the Employer and who work through their release date.

   * $500 per year of service – Part-time employees
   * $1,000 per year of service – Full-time employees

2. Employer retains the right upon notification to the Union to:

   * establish offer dates and release dates
   * terminate or extend the program
   * require employees to sign a waiver and release
   * limit the maximum payout under this program to any employee to 20 years of service

2. The Employer may limit, by bargaining unit, the number of employees who can take this buyout at each store or facility. If more employees elect than permitted—go by seniority.

4. Program not subject to Grievance and Arbitration Procedure

**Effective on ratification, the starting rate in any job classification, excluding courtesy clerks, shall be not less than forty cents ($0.40) above the operative minimum wage applicable to the store, and each rate above will be at least twenty-five cents ($0.25) per hour higher than the previous rate in the progression schedule.**

**Bargaining Note: In applying the provisions of this Letter of Agreement,** the parties **understand, for example,** that an employee working at a progression step that is adjusted as a result of the operation of **this letter** would remain at the same step but work under the newly adjusted rate until they complete the remaining hours of that step and advance to the next step.

2022-2025

The Employer and the Union agree that so long as the pre-packaged items are cross-docked at the Employer's warehouse facilities (i.e. not delivered directly to stores by a vendor), employees covered by the parties' labor agreement will continue to stock the pre-packaged product as they currently do. The Employer and the Union agree that in stores where binned bulk food products currently are offered, as well as any stores where such products are introduced in the future, the Employer may assign all work related to the ordering and servicing of the binned bulk food to a vendor, notwithstanding that it may be cross-docked. The current binned bulk food product assortment consists of 97 items. The Employer may make substitutions of items, but it is understood that if the Employer wishes to increase the number of items beyond 97, the parties will discuss the ordering and in-store servicing of such additional products by a vendor.

12. Apprenticeship Programs.

The parties agree to work together during the term of the new contract to establish appropriate Industry Apprenticeship programs, pursuant to applicable State and Federal training and apprentice guidelines. The Union and the company agree to meet regularly, with a first meeting to be held not later than March 31, 2019, to accomplish these goals.

13. Joint Labor Management Committee.

The Employer and the Union shall establish a Joint Labor-Management Committee whose purpose shall be to investigate, study and discuss mutual solutions to problems affecting Labor Management relations in a sincere attempt to improve the parties' basic relationship. The Committee shall be made up of an equal number of Union and Employer representatives and shall develop its own guidelines as determined by the participants and as approved by the Union and the Employer. The Committee shall not have the authority to modify the terms of this Agreement.

The parties agree that the Joint Labor Management Committee will discuss the trespass of unruly customers from the Employer's stores. The Employer agrees to share information with the Union on a confidential basis, concerning incidents and customers trespassed from the stores. When appropriate, such information will be shared with affected employees.

The parties further agree to discuss the issue of armed and other security guards within the stores during the term of this Agreement. The Employer and the Union agree that guards, including armed guards and off-duty law enforcement, are sometimes appropriate to ensure employee and customer safety. The Employer agrees to discuss with the Union safety and security incidents which may impact the necessity of armed guards. The Employer and Union shall also discuss the installation and use of panic buttons in appropriate locations.

On or before October 31, 2022, the parties shall meet to discuss Journeyperson Meat Cutters [ADDITION FOR ROCK SPRINGS CONTRACTS ONLY: and healthcare for Rock Springs]. [ADDITION FOR DENVER SAFEWAY MEAT CONTRACT ONLY: On or before October 31, 2022, the parties shall meet to discuss the possibility of entering into a new agreement specific to the Meat Warehouse.]
