By using KARL (Knowledge Assistant for Rights and Labor), you acknowledge and agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, **do not use this software.**

### 1. NO LEGAL ADVICE OR REPRESENTATION
KARL is an automated information retrieval system. It is **not** an attorney, a Union Steward, or a Union Representative.
* **No Attorney-Client Relationship:** Use of KARL does not create an attorney-client relationship or a formal union-member representation relationship.

* **Consult a Human:** Always consult with a qualified Union Steward or Union Representative before taking any action regarding your employment, discipline, or contract rights.

### 2. AI HALLUCINATIONS AND ERRORS
KARL utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While we strive for accuracy, **AI systems can and do make mistakes.**
* **"Hallucinations":** The system may generate text that sounds authoritative but is factually incorrect, legally invalid, or based on non-existent contract clauses.
* **Outdated Information:** The contract data in KARL may not reflect the most recent Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), side letters, or arbitration rulings.
* **Verification Required:** You must verify any information provided by KARL against the official, physical copy of your Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
