# KARL — The Union Steward Assistant

KARL is an open-source AI assistant designed to help workers and unions
understand, navigate, and enforce their collective bargaining agreements.

The goal of KARL is to:
- Reduce information asymmetry between workers and employers
- Make labor contracts legible to the people bound by them
- Strengthen collective power through shared understanding

## Core Principles

- Union-first
- Worker-controlled
- Privacy-respecting
- Anti-surveillance
- Transparent by design
