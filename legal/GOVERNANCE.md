# Project Governance

KARL is governed by maintainers aligned with its union-first mission.

## Decision Making

- Maintainers may reject contributions that undermine worker power
- No corporate sponsorship grants governance authority
- Forking is permitted under AGPL—but ethical alignment matters

## Long-Term Vision

KARL aims to remain:
- Open
- Worker-controlled
- Resistant to enclosure
